        "C H A P T E R I<br><b>MISHNAH</b>. . SHAMMAI RULED: FOR ALL WOMEN<sup>1</sup> IT SUFFICES [TO RECKON] THEIR<br>[PERIOD OF UNCLEANNESS FROM THE] TIME [OF THEIR DISCOVERING THE FLOW].<sup>2</sup><br>HILLEL RULED: [THEIR PERIOD OF UNCLEANNESS IS TO BE RECKONED<br>RETROSPECTIVELY] FROM THE [PREVIOUS] EXAMINATION TO THE [LAST]<br>EXAMINATION,<sup>3</sup> EVEN [IF THE INTERVAL EXTENDED] FOR MANY DAYS. THE SAGES,<br>HOWEVER, RULED: [THE LAW IS] NEITHER IN AGREEMENT WITH THE OPINION OF<br>THE FORMER<sup>4</sup> NOR IN AGREEMENT WITH THAT OF THE LATTER,<sup>5</sup> BUT [THE WOMEN<br>ARE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN UNCLEAN] DURING [THE PRECEDING] TWENTY-FOUR<br>HOURS<sup>6</sup> WHEN THIS<sup>7</sup> LESSENS THE PERIOD FROM THE [PREVIOUS] EXAMINATION TO<br>THE [LAST] EXAMINATION, AND DURING THE PERIOD FROM THE [PREVIOUS]<br>EXAMINATION TO THE [LAST] EXAMINATION WHEN THIS<sup>8</sup> LESSENS THE PERIOD OF<br>TWENTY-FOUR HOURS.<br>FOR ANY WOMAN WHO HAS A SETTLED PERIOD IT SUFFICES [TO RECKON HER<br>PERIOD OF UNCLEANNESS FROM] THE TIME SHE DISCOVERS THE FLOW: AND IF A<br>WOMAN USES TESTING-RAGS WHEN<sup>9</sup> SHE HAS MARITAL INTERCOURSE, THIS IS<br>INDEED<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> LIKE AN EXAMINATION WHICH LESSENS EITHER THE PERIOD OF THE<br>[PAST] TWENTY-FOUR HOURS OR THE PERIOD FROM THE [PREVIOUS] EXAMINATION<br>TO THE [LAST] EXAMINATION. HOW [IS ONE TO UNDERSTAND THE RULING THAT]<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup><br>IT SUFFICES [TO RECKON HER PERIOD OF UNCLEANNESS FROM] THE TIME SHE<br>DISCOVERS THE FLOW’? IF SHE WAS SITTING ON A BED AND WAS OCCUPIED WITH<br>RITUALLY CLEAN OBJECTS<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> AND, HAVING LEFT THEM, OBSERVED A FLOW, SHE IS<br>RITUALLY UNCLEAN WHILE THE OBJECTS<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> REMAIN RITUALLY CLEAN.<br>ALTHOUGH THEY<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> HAVE LAID DOWN THAT SHE<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS FOR A<br>PERIOD OF TWENTY-FOUR HOURS [RETROSPECTIVELY]<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> SHE COUNTS [THE SEVEN<br>DAYS OF HER MENSTRUATION]<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> ONLY FROM THE TIME SHE OBSERVED THE FLOW.<br><b>GEMARA</b>. What is Shammai's reason?<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> — He is of the opinion that a woman<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> should be<br>presumed to enjoy<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> her usual status, and the status of the woman<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> was one of cleanness.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> And<br>Hillel?<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> — When is it said that an object is presumed to possess its usual status? Only when the<br>unfavourable condition<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> is not internal;<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> but as regards a woman,<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) In respect of menstrual uncleanness.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) It being assumed that up to that moment there was no vestige of blood even in the ante-chamber (cf. Mishnah infra<br><sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>a). Hence only objects that were touched by the woman after the discovery become ritually unclean. All objects<br>touched prior to that moment remain clean.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) When she discovered the discharge. If the last, for instance, took place at <sup>5</sup> p.m. on a Thursday and the previous one<br>at <sup>8</sup> a.m. on the preceding Sunday, all objects touched since the Sunday examination are deemed to be ritually unclean<br>because it is assumed that some blood, prevented from leaving the body by the walls of the womb, may have made its<br>way into the ante-chamber immediately after that examination.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Shammai, whose ruling is too lenient.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Hillel, who is too restrictive, since blood could not well be retained in the ante-chamber for a very long time.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Me'eth le'eth, lit., ‘from time to time’.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) An interval of more than twenty-four hours having intervened between the two examinations.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) The two examinations having taken place within twenty-four hours.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Before and after.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Lit., ‘behold this’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) In the case of ‘ANY WOMAN WHO HAS A SETTLED PERIOD (supra).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) In the preparation, for instance, of foodstuffs.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) The bed, and the foodstuffs which she handled.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) The Sages.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) A woman who had no settled period.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) From the time she observed the flow.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Prescribed in Lev. XV, <sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) For his ruling in the first clause of our Mishnah.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) About whom it is uncertain when her flow began.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Lit., ‘cause to stand . . . upon’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Spoken of in our Mishnah.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Since she was occupied with ritually clean things.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) How, in view of Shammai's reason, can he maintain his ruling.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Which might impair its status.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) But is due to some external cause. MS.M. adds, ‘as, for instance, when it is doubtful whether one did, or did not<br>touch (an unclean object)’.",
        "since what she observes [is a discharge] from her own body, it cannot be held that she is presumed to<br>have her usual status.<br>Wherein, however, does this<sup>1</sup> essentially differ<sup>2</sup> from that of a ritual bath of which we learnt: If a<br>ritual bath<sup>3</sup> was measured and found lacking, all purifications that have heretofore been effected<br>through it, whether it was in a public<sup>4</sup> or in a private domain,<sup>5</sup> are regarded<sup>6</sup> as unclean?<sup>7</sup> According<br>to Shammai<sup>8</sup> the difficulty arises from ‘heretofore’; while according to Hillel the difficulty arises,<br>does it not, from the certainty; for, whereas in the case of the twenty-four hours’ period<sup>9</sup> of the<br>menstruant [any terumah<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> she touched] is only held in suspense, it being neither eaten nor burned,<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup><br>here<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> the uncleanness is regarded as a certainty?<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> — The reason<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> there<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> is that it may be<br>postulated that the unclean person shall be regarded as being in his presumptive status<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> and<br>assumed<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> not to have performed proper immersion.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> On the contrary! Why not postulate that the<br>ritual bath shall be regarded as being in its presumptive status of validity and assume that it was not<br>lacking?<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> — Surely a lacking [bath] is before you. But in this case also,<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> is not blood before you?<br>— She has only just now observed it.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> In that case<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> too, is it not<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> lacking only just now?<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> —<br>What a comparison!<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> In that case<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> it might well be presumed that the water was gradually<br>diminishing,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> but can it here also be presumed that she was gradually observing the flow?<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> —<br>What an objection is this! Is it not possible that she observed the blood only when it was coming in<br>profusion?<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> — In the former case<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> there are two unfavourable factors<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> while in the latter<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> there is<br>only one unfavourable factor.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> Wherein, however,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> does this<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> differ from the case of the jug<br>concerning which we have learnt:<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> If one tested<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> a wine jug for the purpose of periodically taking<br>from it terumah [for wine kept in other jugs]<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> and, subsequently,<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> it was found to contain<br>vinegar,<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> all<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> three days it is certain,<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> and after that it is doubtful.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> Now does not this<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> present an<br>objection against Shammai?<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> — The reason there<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> is that it can be postulated that the tebel<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> shall<br>be regarded as having its presumptive status, and then it may be presumed that it had not been<br>ritually prepared.<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> On the contrary! Why not postulate that the wine be regarded as having its<br>presumptive status<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> and then it might be assumed that it had not become sour? — Surely it stands<br>sour before you. But in that case also<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> is there not blood before you? — She has only just now<br>observed it. But in that case too<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> is it not sour only just now? — What a comparison! In the latter<br>case<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> it might well be presumed that the wine turned sour by degrees,<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> but can it also be said in the<br>former case<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> that she observed the flow by degrees?<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> — What an objection is this! Is it not possible<br>that she observed the blood only when it came in profusion? — In the former case<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> there are two<br>unfavourable factors<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> while in the latter<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> there is only one such factor.<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup><br>An incongruity, however, was pointed out between the case of the jug<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> and that of the ritual<br>bath:<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> Wherein lies the essential difference between the two<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> that in the latter case<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> [the<br>retrospective uncleanness is regarded as] a certainty while in that of the former<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> [the uncleanness of<br>the terumah is deemed] doubtful? — R. Hanina of Sura replied: Who is the author [of the ruling<br>concerning the] jug? R. Simeon, who in respect of a ritual bath also regards [the retrospective<br>uncleanness] as a matter of doubt; for it was taught:<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> If a ritual bath was measured and found<br>lacking all purifications heretofore effected through it whether it was in a public or in a private<br>domain, are regarded as unclean.<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> R. Simeon ruled: In a public domain they are regarded as clean<br>but in a private domain they are regarded as being in suspense.<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup><br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) The case of the menstruant.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Both according to Shammai and Hillel.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Which must contain a minimum of forty se'ah of water.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Where a case of doubtful uncleanness is elsewhere regarded as clean.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Where a doubtful case is regarded as unclean (cf. prev. n.).<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Since the bath is now ritually invalid.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Mik. II, <sup>2</sup>.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Who ruled that the period of uncleanness of menstruant women begins FROM THE TIME OF THEIR DISCOVERY<br>OF THE FLOW and not retrospectively.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) According to the Sages; or the interval between her last and previous examinations according to Hillel (v. our<br><b>MISHNAH</b>).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) V. Glos.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) As explained infra <sup>6</sup>a.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) In the case of the ritual bath, where it is categorically stated ‘are retrospectively unclean’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) And the terumah must be burned.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) For the restrictions.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) The case of the ritual bath.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Of uncleanness, which before valid immersion is a certainty.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) On account of the discovered invalidity of the ritual bath he used.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Since the invalidity may have begun at the time the immersion took place.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) At the time of the immersion.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) That of the menstruant.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Hence there is no need to assume that the flow began any earlier.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Ritual bath.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) As far as is known.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Why then should it be assumed to have been lacking earlier?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) Lit., ‘thus, now’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) So that the presumptive state of validity has long ago been impaired. And since it is not known when the process<br>began the restrictive ruling given is well justified.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) Obviously not. Hence it may well be assumed that the flow began only at the moment when it was discovered.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) While in fact a particle of it which is quite sufficient to cause uncleanness (cf. infra <sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) may have been in the<br>antechamber long before she was aware of any flow.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) That of the ritual bath.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) The assumption that the unclean person was in his confirmed status of uncleanness and the lacking condition of the<br>bath.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) The case of the menstruant.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) The present observation of the blood. Since against this factor there is the favourable one of the woman's previous<br>condition of confirmed cleanness it may well be assumed that the flow began not earlier than the moment when it was<br>observed.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) According to Shammai.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) What follows is a Baraitha (Tosef. Ter. IV) and is quoted here as Mishnah. This is not an isolated instance. V.<br>Higger Ozar ha Beraitoth, pp. <sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>ff.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) Either by tasting some of its contents (Rashi) the terumah and tithe having been duly taken from it (Rashb. B.B.<br><sup>9</sup><sup>6</sup>a) or by smelling it (Tosaf. l.c.).<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) In order that he might be allowed to use the wine in the other jugs he keeps this one jug for the purpose of taking<br>from it daily, or whenever required, the appropriate quantity of wine as terumah or tithe for the wine in the other jugs.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) After a month or two, for instance.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) A liquid which (according to Rabbi, B.B. <sup>8</sup><sup>4</sup>b) may not be used as terumah for wine.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) So MS.M. and Rashal. Cur. edd. in parenthesis insert ‘the first’.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) V. following note.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) Tosef. Ter. IV. The meaning according to R. Johanan (B.B. <sup>9</sup><sup>6</sup>a) is that during the first three days after the test the<br>contents of the jug are regarded as ‘certain’ wine because in less than three days wine cannot turn into vinegar. Even if it<br>be assumed that it began to turn sour immediately after the test it could not be called ‘vinegar’ until full three days had<br>elapsed. The terumah given within these three days must inevitably have been wine and consequently have exempted the<br>wine in the other jugs. After three days the contents are regarded as ‘doubtful wine’ since it is possible that the wine<br>began to deteriorate only three days before it was found to be vinegar, into which it may have turned just at that moment.<br>As the terumah is accordingly of a doubtful nature another portion must be set aside for the purpose. The meaning<br>according to R. Joshua b. Levi (ibid.) is that during the last three days prior to the discovery that it had turned into<br>vinegar, it is regarded as ‘certain’ vinegar because, in his opinion, the contents are deemed to be vinegar as soon as the<br>wine begins to deteriorate in odour though its taste may still be that of wine. Since it is now proper vinegar the<br>deterioration must have commenced at least three days earlier. Prior to the three days it is regarded as ‘doubtful’ because<br>it is unknown when the deterioration had set in.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) The ruling in the Baraitha cited according to which where unfavourable factors exist restrictions are applied<br>retrospectively.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) Who ruled in our Mishnah that menstruants are not deemed to have been unclean for any length of time<br>retrospectively, but reckon their period of uncleanness only from the moment OF THEIR DISCOVERING THE FLOW.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) In the Baraitha cited.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) The untithed wine, v. Glos.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) Sc. that the priestly and levitical dues have not been duly set aside for it.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup>) Of being wine.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup>) That of the menstruant.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup>) That of the jug of wine.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>) So that it lost its status long before it completely turned into vinegar.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup>) Of course not. Hence the assumption that the flow began the moment it was discovered.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup>) The confirmed status of the wine as tebel and its present sour condition.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup>) The present observation of the blood.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup>) Cited supra from Tosef. Ter. IV.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup>) Mik. II, <sup>2</sup>, also cited supra.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup>) In both of which (as stated supra) there are equally two unfavourable factors.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup>) Mik. II, <sup>2</sup>.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup>) Cited supra from Tosef. Ter. IV.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup>) So marg. gl. Cur. edd. ‘we learnt’.<br>(<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup>) Supra q.v. notes.<br>(<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup>) Tosef. Mik. I; the reason is discussed infra.",
        "And both<sup>1</sup> deduced it<sup>2</sup> from no other law than that of sotah.<sup>3</sup> The Rabbis<sup>4</sup> hold [that the law of the<br>ritual bath is the same] as that of sotah; as [the offence of] the sotah is a matter of doubt and is<br>regarded as a certainty<sup>5</sup> so here also<sup>6</sup> [where the uncleanness is] a matter of doubt it is regarded as a<br>certainty. If [the inference, however, is made] from the sotah might it not be argued: It is like the<br>sotah in this respect, viz., that as the sotah is clean [if she is suspected of an offence] in a public<br>domain<sup>7</sup> so should [all the purifications effected in] this case also<sup>6</sup> be regarded as clean [if the bath<br>was] in a public domain? — What a comparison!<sup>8</sup> There<sup>9</sup> the cause<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> is seclusion<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> but seclusion in a<br>public domain is impossible,<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> but here,<sup>6</sup> the cause<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> being the deficiency,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> what matters it whether<br>the deficiency takes place in a public, or in a private domain?<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> And should you argue: Is not every<br>doubtful case of ritual uncleanness in a public domain regarded as clean [it could be retorted:] Since<br>[in the case of the bath] there are two unfavourable factors<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> it is regarded as certain uncleanness. R.<br>Simeon, however, holds [that the law of the ritual bath is the same as that of sotah [in this respect]:<br>As the sotah is regarded as clean [where she is suspected of an offence] in a public domain so also<br>here<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> [are all the purifications effected regarded as] clean [if the bath was] In a public domain. If<br>[the inference, however, is made] from the sotah, might it not be argued: It is like the sotah in this<br>respect viz., that as the sotah [if suspected of the offence] in a private domain is regarded as<br>definitely unclean so should also [all purifications effected in this case] be deemed to be definitely<br>unclean [where the bath was] in a private domain? — What a comparison!<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> In that case<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> there is<br>some basis for the suspicion,<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> seeing that he<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> had warned her and she had secluded herself with the<br>stranger; what basis for uncleanness,<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> however, is there here?<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup><br>And if you prefer I might say that this is R. Simeon's reason:<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> He infers the law of the termination<br>of uncleanness<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> from that of the inception of uncleanness;<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> as with the inception of uncleanness if<br>it is doubtful whether an object has or has not touched an uncleanness in a public domain it is<br>deemed to be clean, so also with the termination of uncleanness, if it is doubtful whether an object<br>had been duly immersed or not, in a public domain it is deemed to be clean. And the Rabbis?<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> —<br>What an inference!<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> There,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> since the man is in the presumptive status of ritual cleanness, we<br>cannot on account of a doubt transfer him to a state of uncleanness, but here,<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> seeing that the man is<br>in the presumptive status of uncleanness, we cannot on account of a doubt release him from his<br>uncleanness.<br>Wherein, however, does this<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> essentially differ<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> from the case of an alley of which we learnt: If a<br>dead creeping thing was found in an alley it causes ritual uncleanness retrospectively<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> to such time<br>as one can testify, ‘I examined this alley and there was no creeping thing in it’,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> or to such time as it<br>was last swept?<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> — There<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> also, since there are creeping things from the alley itself and also<br>creeping things that make their way into it from the outside world, the case is the same as one that<br>has two unfavourable factors. And if you prefer I might reply,<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> This is Shammai's reason:<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> Because<br>a woman is herself conscious [when she suffers a flow].<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> And Hillel?<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> — She might have thought<br>that the sensation<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> was that of urine. As to Shammai, is there not [the possibility of suffering a flow<br>while] asleep?<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> — A woman asleep too would<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> awake on account of the pain,<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> as is the case<br>where one feels a discharge of urine.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> But is there not the case of an imbecile?<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> — Shammai<br>agrees<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> in the case of an imbecile. But did he not state, ALL WOMEN?<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> — [He meant:] All<br>sensible women. Then why did he not merely state WOMEN?<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> — He intended to indicate that the<br>law is not in agreement with R. Eliezer; for R. Eliezer mentioned ‘Four classes of women’<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> and no<br>more, hence he<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> informed us [that the law applies to] ALL WOMEN. But is there not the case of<br>stains?<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> Must we then<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> assume that we learnt the Mishnah about stains<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> in disagreement with<br>Shammai? — Abaye replied: Shammai agrees<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> in the case of stains. What is the reason? — Since<br>she was neither handling a slaughtered bird nor was she passing through the butchers’ market,<br>whence could that blood have come?<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> And<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> if you prefer I might reply, This is Shammai's reason:<br>If in fact any blood were there<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> it would have flowed out earlier.<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> And Hillel?<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> — The walls of<br>the womb may have held it back.<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> And Shammai?<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> — The walls of the womb do not hold blood<br>back. But what can be said for a woman<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> who<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> uses an absorbent in her marital intercourse?<sup>6</sup><sup>4</sup> —<br>Abaye replied: Shammai agrees<sup>6</sup><sup>5</sup> in the case of one who uses an absorbent,<sup>6</sup><sup>6</sup> Raba replied: An<br>absorbent too [does not affect Shammai's ruling, since] perspiration causes it to shrink.<sup>6</sup><sup>7</sup> Raba,<br>however, agrees<sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup> in the case of a tightly packed absorbent.<sup>6</sup><sup>9</sup><br>What, however, is the practical difference between the latter explanations<sup>7</sup><sup>0</sup> and the former<br>explanation?<sup>7</sup><sup>1</sup><br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) R. Simeon and the first Tanna.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Each his respective rulings in the Baraitha just cited.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) V. Glos., in connection with whom Scripture speaks of uncleanness or defilement (cf. Num. V, <sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>).<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Sc. the first Tanna (cf. supra n. <sup>7</sup>).<br>(<sup>5</sup>) A sotah, until her innocence is proved by the test (cf. Num. V, <sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>-<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>), being definitely forbidden to her husband.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) The case of the ritual bath under discussion.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Where no privacy is possible.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Lit., ‘thus, now’.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Sotah.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Of the woman's uncleanness or prohibition to her husband.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Of the woman with the suspected stranger.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Hence the ruling that in such a case the woman is deemed clean.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) Of uncleanness.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Of the water in the bath.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) Nothing. Hence the Rabbis’ ruling that all purifications effected, irrespective of domain, are deemed to be unclean.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) As pointed out supra <sup>2</sup>b.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) The case of the ritual bath under discussion.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Lit., ‘thus, now’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Sotah.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Lit., ‘there are feet for the thing’<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Her husband.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) In the case of the bath. As there is no basis whatever for the assumption that this deficiency occurred before the<br>purifications had been effected it may well be assumed that it occurred afterwards immediately before the bath was<br>measured. It has thus been shown, as R. Hanina replied supra, that according to R. Simeon all cases of doubtful<br>uncleanness in a private domain where there is no basis for the affirmation of the uncleanness, are regarded as being in<br>suspense.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) For holding doubtful cases of uncleanness in a public domain to be clean.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Sc. ritual immersion which takes place when the period of uncleanness is concluded.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) I.e., uncleanness contracted from coming in contact with an unclean object.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) How, in view of R. Simeon's inference, could they maintain (v. supra <sup>2</sup>b ad fin.) that ‘all purifications . . . whether it<br>was in a public or in a private domain, are unclean’?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) Lit., ‘thus, now’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) The case of the inception of uncleanness.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) In a case of termination of uncleanness.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) The case of the menstruant in our Mishnah.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) According to Shammai.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) To all clean objects that were in the alley prior to its discovery.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) Sc. only clean objects that were in the alley prior to that examination are ritually clean since the examination has<br>established that during that time there was no creeping thing in the alley.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) Infra <sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup>a; and no creeping thing was found. The sweeping, which is presumably accompanied by a search for any<br>unclean things, has the same force as a direct examination. Hence (cf. prev. n.) only objects that were in the alley prior to<br>the sweeping are clean while those that were there after the sweeping, since a creeping thing may have fallen into the<br>alley immediately after the sweeping was over, are regarded as unclean. Now seeing that here uncleanness in a doubtful<br>case is caused retrospectively, why does Shammai in our Mishnah restrict the period of uncleanness to the time of<br>THEIR DISCOVERING only?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) The case of the alley in the Mishnah just cited.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) To the objection raised against Shammai.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) For his ruling that menstruants begin their period of uncleanness from the time OF THEIR DISCOVERING OF<br>THE FLOW only and not, as in the case of the alley, retrospectively.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) As she did not feel any prior to her present discovery it may be safely assumed that previously there had not been<br>any.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) How, in view of this argument, can he maintain that a menstruant's uncleanness is RECKONED<br>RETROSPECTIVELY?<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) Of the menstrual flow.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) When the woman is unconscious of it.

        "— The practical difference between them is the possibility of pointing out an incongruity [between<br>the ruling in our Mishnah and the rulings concerning] the jug, the ritual bath and the alley:<sup>1</sup><br>According to the former explanation such an incongruity may justifiably be pointed out<sup>1</sup> while<br>according to the latter explanations such an incongruity does not exist. But what practical difference<br>is there [in the case of the latter] between the one and the other explanation? — According to Abaye<sup>2</sup><br>there is the case of the absorbent,<sup>3</sup> and according to Raba<sup>2</sup> there is the case of the absorbent tightly<br>packed.<sup>4</sup> It was taught in agreement with that explanation that ‘if in fact any blood were there it<br>would have flowed out earlier’: Hillel said to Shammai, ‘Do you not agree that in the case of a<br>basket one corner of which was used for levitically clean objects while in another corner was found<sup>5</sup><br>a dead creeping thing, the objects that were formerly clean are regarded as unclean retrospectively?’<sup>6</sup><br>— ‘Indeed’, the other replied. ‘Then [Hillel rejoined] what is the difference between the one case<br>and the other?’<sup>7</sup> — ‘The one<sup>8</sup> [Shammai replied] has a bottom,<sup>9</sup> the other<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> has none.’<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> Raba stated:<br>Shammai's reason<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> is to avoid<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> neglect of marital life.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> So it was also taught: Shammai said to<br>Hillel, ‘If so,<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> you cause the daughters of Israel the neglect of marital life’.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> Now according to<br>him<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> who taught this explanation<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> [it may be objected:] Was it not taught,<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> in agreement with the<br>former explanation,<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> that ‘if in fact any blood were there it would have flowed out earlier’? —<br>There<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> it was Hillel who erred. He thought that Shammai's reason was that if any blood had been<br>there it would have flowed out earlier and, therefore, he raised an objection against him from the<br>case of the basket,<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> but Shammai answered him, ‘My reason is the avoidance of the neglect of<br>marital life; and as regards your erroneous assumption too, in consequence of which you raised an<br>objection from the case of the basket, the latter has a bottom while the former has none.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup><br>But according to him who taught<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> the first explanation<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> [it may be objected:] Was it not in fact<br>taught, in agreement with the latter version, that the reason is to avoid the neglect of propagation? It<br>is this that Hillel in fact said to Shammai, ‘Even if you give as your reason that \"if in fact any blood<br>were there it would have flowed out earlier,\" you must nevertheless make a fence<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> for your ruling,<br>for why should this law be different from all the Torah for which a fence is made?’ To this the other<br>replied, ‘If so,<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> you would cause the daughters of Israel to neglect marital life’.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> And Hillel?<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> —<br>‘Do I [he can reply] speak of marital life?<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> I only speak of levitical cleanness’. And Shammai?<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> —<br>[Restrictions, he holds, must] not [be imposed] even as regards levitical cleanness, since otherwise<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup><br>the man might have scruples<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> and keep away altogether.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup><br>(Mnemonic:<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> Bottom examined covered in a corner.)<br>It was stated: If one corner of a basket was used for levitically clean objects and a dead creeping<br>thing was found in another corner, Hezekiah ruled that the objects that were formerly<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> clean remain<br>clean. R. Johanan ruled: The objects that were formerly<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> clean are now regarded as retrospectively<br>unclean. But do not Shammai<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> and Hillel in fact agree<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> in the case of a basket that the objects that<br>were formerly clean are deemed to be retrospectively unclean?<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> — Shammai and Hillel agree<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> only<br>in the case of a basket that had a bottom,<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> while Hezekiah and R. Johanan differ in that of a basket<br>that had no bottom.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> But if the basket had no bottom what could be R. Johanan's reason?<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> — It had<br>no bottom, but it had<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> a rim.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> But surely, it was taught:<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> ‘If a man drew<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> ten buckets of water one<br>after the other<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> and a creeping thing was found in one of them, this one<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> is unclean and all the<br>others<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> remain clean’;<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> and in connection with this Resh Lakish citing R. Jannai stated, ‘This<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> was<br>taught only in a case where the bucket had no rim<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> but if it had a rim<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> all the buckets of water are<br>deemed to be unclean.’ Now must it be assumed that Hezekiah<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> does not adopt the view of R.<br>Jannai?<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> — [No, since] water<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> glides<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> while fruits<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> do not glide;<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> or else [it may be replied] one<br>is not particular with water<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> but with fruit one is particular.<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> And if you prefer I might reply:<br>Shammai and Hillel agree<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> only in respect of a basket that was not [previously]<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> examined<sup>6</sup><sup>4</sup><br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Supra <sup>2</sup>b and <sup>3</sup>a.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Supra <sup>3</sup>a ad fin.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) If the explanation is that ‘a woman feels’ the period of menstrual uncleanness would begin at the time of the<br>discovery of the blood even where a woman used an absorbent, while if the explanation is that ‘it would have flowed out<br>earlier’ uncleanness would begin retrospectively since the discharge might have begun earlier but was soaked up by the<br>absorbent.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Cf. prev. note.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) After the clean objects had been removed from the basket.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Lit., ‘the former clean are unclean’, because it is possible that the creeping thing was in the basket before the objects<br>had been removed and that it consequently imparted uncleanness to the basket from which it was conveyed to the<br>objects. If the creeping thing, it may be added, had been found in the same corner in which the objects were previously<br>kept there could be no question that the latter remain clean, since it may be regarded as certain that they had been<br>removed before the creeping thing had fallen into the basket.

        "while Hezekiah and R. Johanan differ in the case of a basket that had been examined.

Hence the basket also, which is in a similar condition (cf. prev. n. but one), must be deemed to be<br>duly examined. Now since it was stated that the objects that were in the basket were regarded as retrospectively unclean<br>an objection arises against Hezekiah.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) And so also the basket. Hence the justification for Hezekiah's ruling.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) To the difficulty raised supra <sup>3</sup>b ad fin on the apparent contradiction between the joint ruling of Shammai and Hillel<br>and the view of Hezekiah.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) MS.M. ‘Shammai agrees with Hillel’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) Though examined.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) So that the creeping thing might well have fallen in as soon as the examiner has removed his hand.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) Into which nothing could fall in by accident. Hence the justification for Hezekiah's ruling that the objects are clean.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Which was actually found in it.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Hezekiah is of the opinion that as long as clean objects are in the basket one is careful to keep it closed in order to<br>prevent any unclean object from falling into it, but when the basket is empty care is no longer exercised and it is quite<br>possible, therefore, for the creeping thing to have fallen in then. R. Johanan, however, holds that it is possible for the<br>creeping thing to have fallen in unobserved, even while the clean objects were still in the basket, at a moment when the<br>latter was opened in the ordinary course of use.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Hillel having asked (supra <sup>3</sup>b) ‘what is the difference between the one case and the other?’<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Since no blood from the outside can flow into her body.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Cf. supra p. <sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>, n. <sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>, mut. mut.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) And so also the basket. Hence the justification for Hezekiah's ruling.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) V. supra p. <sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>, n. <sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) MS.M., ‘Shammai agrees with Hillel’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) This is explained presently. Lit., ‘house’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) In the statement, supra <sup>3</sup>b ad fin, under discussion.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) After the objects had been taken out.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) If the unclean object was first discovered in the second place.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) It is rather assumed that the creeping thing fell into the basket when it was already in the second place after the<br>objects had been removed from it.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) Even in such a case.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) Lit., ‘as the time of their finding’, Toh. V, <sup>7</sup>.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Sc. if in the morning the person was found dead in the place where he was touched in the night the man who<br>touched him is unclean, but if he was found dead in a different place he remains clean. Thus it follows that we do not<br>presume uncleanness found in one place to apply to another. How then could R. Johanan maintain that the rule is applied<br>even in such a case?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) That the rule that we do not presume uncleanness found in one place to apply to another.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) Since the uncleanness is not a matter of certainty.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) If it was terumah; sc. the terumah need not be burned on account of the doubtful nature (cf. prev. n.) of its<br>uncleanness.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) Lit., ‘to suspend we suspend’, i.e., the uncleanness of the objects thus affected is treated as a matter of doubt, and R.<br>Johanan's ruling might be given the same interpretation and may thus be reconciled with that of the Mishnah just cited.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) That was known to be unclean.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) In contact with clean objects.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) Conditions which render it useless as a ‘vessel’.

Hence it is assumed that’ the objects and the needle came in contact after the latter had lost the status of<br>‘vessel’ when it was no longer able to convey any uncleanness.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) That the objects should be regarded as absolutely clean and their uncleanness should not be regarded even as<br>doubtful.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) When it first came in contact with the objects under discussion.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) When it duly conveyed its uncleanness to the objects.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) Since, however, the assumption is not made and the objects are not subjected either to a certain or to a suspended<br>condition of uncleanness, even, presumably, where there was a change of place, how could R. Johanan maintain, even<br>only in respect of a condition of suspense, that the rule of presumptive uncleanness is applied?<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) Aliter: scorched.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) That was cut off from the unclean garment of a zab (v. Glos.).<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup>) Sc. it is assumed that the creeping thing or the rag did not come in contact with the olives until after it had lost its<br>uncleanness (the former by the burning and the latter by becoming tattered or scorched) and was unable to convey any.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup>) Toh. IX, <sup>9</sup>. Now since the olives are not subjected even to the status of suspended uncleanness (as the categorical<br>rule ‘it is clean’ implies) it follows that presumptive uncleanness does not apply when there was a change of time and so<br>also, presumably, where there was a change of place. How then could R. Johanan maintain his ruling?<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup>) As in the case of the needle and the rag (cited from Toh. III, <sup>5</sup> and IX, <sup>9</sup>) where the objects are declared clean.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>) Where a man touched some person in the night (cited from Toh. V, <sup>7</sup>) in which case the man, according to the<br>Sages, is decidedly unclean.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup>) The objects about which the doubt had arisen.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup>) I.e., whence the objects have been removed, as is the case with the basket with which R. Johanan was concerned.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup>) Terumah, for instance.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup>) And the same interpretation might also be given to R. Johanan's ruling which would thus be reconciled with the one<br>cited from Toh. IX, <sup>9</sup>.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup>) V. marg. glos. Cur. edd. ‘we learnt’.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup>) On the ground.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup>) Middaf. This is now assumed to be an object (a garment, for instance) which, though not subject to midras (v.<br>Glos.) uncleanness (which could convey uncleanness to both man and vessels) conveys nevertheless uncleanness to<br>foodstuffs and the like, Pentateuchally.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup>) Found on the ground away from the unclean object.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup>) Which would have conveyed uncleanness to it.<br>(<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup>) From the shelf, and placed it on the ground where it was found.<br>(<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup>) Tosef. Toh. IV.<br>(<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup>) ‘That a clean person entered etc.’<br>(<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup>) From which the loaf is most likely to slide down and fall on the unclean object below. Now, since even in such a<br>case it is not presumed that the loaf fell upon the unclean object and contracted uncleanness before it rolled away to its<br>present position, it follows that the rule of presumptive uncleanness is not applied when two different places are<br>involved. How then could R. Johanan rule supra (<sup>3</sup>b ad fin.) that presumptive uncleanness is applied even (as in the case<br>of the basket and the creeping thing) where two places are involved?<br>(<sup>6</sup><sup>4</sup>) In the Baraitha just cited.<br>(<sup>6</sup><sup>5</sup>) Why the rule of presumptive uncleanness is not applied to the loaf.<br>(<sup>6</sup><sup>6</sup>) Lit. — ‘as he learned the reason’.",
        "‘Because it is assumed that a clean person entered there and removed it’.<sup>1</sup> But why should it not be<br>assumed here also<sup>2</sup> that a raven came and dropped [the creeping thing into the basket]?<sup>3</sup> — In the<br>case of a man who acts<sup>4</sup> with intention such an assumption<sup>5</sup> is made, but in that of a raven which<sup>6</sup><br>does not act with intention such an assumption<sup>7</sup> is not made. But consider: The loaf<sup>8</sup> is a case of<br>doubtful uncleanness in a private domain. Now is not any case of doubtful uncleanness in a private<br>domain regarded as unclean?<sup>9</sup> — [The loaf is deemed to be unclean] because it is a thing that<br>possesses no intelligence to answer questions,<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> and any thing that possesses no intelligence to<br>answer questions, irrespective of whether it was in a public or in a private domain, is in any doubtful<br>case of uncleanness regarded as clean.<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> And if you prefer I might reply: Here<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> we are dealing with<br>a Rabbinical uncleanness.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> A deduction [from the wording]<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> also supports this view, for the<br>expression used is ‘middaf’<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> which is analogous to the Scriptural phrase, ‘a driven [niddaf] leaf’.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup><br>THE SAGES, HOWEVER, RULED: [THE LAW IS] NEITHER IN AGREEMENT WITH THE<br>OPINION OF THE FORMER NOR IN AGREEMENT WITH THAT OF THE LATTER etc. Our<br>Rabbis taught: And the Sages ruled, [The law is] neither in agreement with the opinion of the former<br>nor in agreement with that of the latter, neither [that is] in agreement with the opinion of Shammai<br>who<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> provided no fence for his ruling<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> nor in agreement with the opinion of Hillel who<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> restricted<br>far too much,<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> but [the women are deemed to be unclean] during the preceding twenty-four hours<br>when this lessens the period from the [previous] examination to the [last] examination, and during<br>the period from the [previous] examination to the [last] examination when this lessens the period of<br>twenty-four hours. ‘[The women are deemed to be unclean] during the preceding twenty-four hours<br>when this lessens the period from the [previous] examination to the [last] examination’. How is this<br>to be understood? If a woman examined her body on a Sunday<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> and found herself to be clean and<br>then she spent Monday and Tuesday without holding any examination while on Wednesday she<br>examined herself and found that she was unclean, it is not ruled that she should be deemed to be<br>unclean retrospectively from the previous examination to the last examination but only [that she<br>should be deemed to be unclean] during the preceding twenty-four hours. ‘And during the period<br>from the [previous] examination to the [last] examination when this lessens the period of twenty-four<br>hours’. How is this to be understood? If the woman examined her body during the first hour of the<br>day and found herself to be clean and then she spent the second and the third hour without holding<br>any examination while in the fourth hour she examined herself and found that she was unclean, it is<br>not ruled that she should be deemed to be unclean retrospectively for a period of twenty-four hours<br>but only during the period from the previous examination to the last examination. But is it not<br>obvious that, since she has examined herself during the first hour and found that she was clean, she<br>is not to be deemed unclean retrospectively for twenty-four hours?<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> — As it was taught, ‘during the<br>preceding twenty-four hours when this lessens the period from the [previous] examination to the<br>[last] examination’<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> it also stated,<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> ‘during the period from the [previous] examination to the [last]<br>examination when this lessens the period of twenty-four hours’.<br>Rabbah stated: What is the reason of the Rabbis?<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> Because a woman well feels herself.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> Said<br>Abaye to him: If so,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> [a period of uncleanness from] the time of her observation of the flow should<br>suffice!<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> And Rabbah?<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> — He only wished to exercise Abaye's wits.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> What then is the reason of<br>the Rabbis?<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> — It is one such as that which Rab Judah gave in the name of Samuel: The Sages have<br>ordained for the daughters of Israel that they should examine themselves in the morning and in the<br>evening; ‘in the morning’, in order to verify the cleanness of objects they handled during the<br>previous night,<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> ‘and in the evening’ in order to verify the cleanness of objects they handled during<br>the previous day;<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> but this woman,<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> since she did not [regularly] examine her body,<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> has<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> lost<br>one ‘onah.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> But what could be meant by ‘one ‘onah’?<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> — One additional ‘onah.<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> Said R. Papa to<br>Raba: But would you not sometimes find that there are three ‘onahs in twenty-four hours?<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> — The<br>Sages have laid down a uniform limit<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> in order that there shall be no variations in the twenty-four<br>hours’ period. And<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> if you prefer I might reply:<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> [the period extends to three ‘onahs] in order that<br>the sinner<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> shall not<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> be at an advantage.<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> What is the practical difference between them?<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> —<br>The practical difference between them is the case of a woman who was the victim of circumstances<br>and in consequence of which she did not hold her examination.<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup><br>FOR ANY WOMAN WHO HAS A SETTLED PERIOD etc. Must it be conceded that our<br><b>MISHNAH</b> represents the view of R. Dosa and not that of the Rabbis seeing that it was taught:<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> R.<br>Eliezer ruled, For four classes of women it suffices [to reckon the period of their uncleanness from<br>the time they discovered the discharge,] viz., a virgin,<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> a pregnant woman, a woman that gives suck<br>and an old woman; and R. Dosa ruled, For any woman who has a settled period it suffices [to reckon<br>her period of uncleanness from] the time she discovered the discharge?<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> — It may even be held<br>[that our Mishnah represents the view of] the Rabbis, for the Rabbis differ from R. Dosa only [in<br>respect of a flow] that did not occur at the woman's set time<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> but [in the case of one that did occur]<br>at her set time they might agree with him; and our Mishnah deals with a flow that occurred at the<br>woman's set time and it, therefore, represents the view of both.<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> Thus<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> it follows that R. Dosa<br>maintains his view even where a flow did not occur at the woman's set time. Who then is the author<br>of the following which the Rabbis taught: Though a woman has a settled period her bloodstain<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> is<br>deemed to be unclean retrospectively,<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> for were she to observe a flow when it is not her set time she<br>would be unclean retrospectively for a period of twenty-four hours?<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> Must it be conceded<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> to be<br>the Rabbis only and not R. Dosa?<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> — It may be said to be even R. Dosa; for R. Dosa may disagree<br>with the Rabbis only in the case where the flow occurred at the woman's set time but where it<br>occurred when it was not her set time he agrees with them;<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> and our Mishnah deals with one that<br>occurred at her set time and it is, therefore, in agreement with the opinion of R. Dosa<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) This assumption cannot, of course, be made in the case of the basket, with which R. Johanan deals, since the unclean<br>object (the dead creeping thing) was actually found in it, and when it was found it was still in its state of uncleanness.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) In the case of the basket and the creeping thing.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) After the clean objects had been removed from it and after it had been moved into its new position.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) When he removed the loaf from the sloping shelf.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) That the man entered and moved the loaf to its present safer place.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Even if it were to drop the creeping thing into the basket.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) That the raven dropped the thing after the clean objects had been removed etc. (cf. supra n. <sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>).<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Since (a) it is uncertain whether it touched the unclean object or not and (b) it was found within a house.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) The answer being in the affirmative, the difficulty arises, why is the loaf deemed to be clean?<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Lit., ‘to be asked’, whether it came in contact with the unclean object or not.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Because the rule that doubtful uncleanness in a private domain is deemed to be unclean is deduced from that of<br>sotah (v. Glos.) and consequently only rational beings like the sotah herself (who is able to answer whether she was or<br>was not defiled) are subject to the same restrictions.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) In the case of the loaf.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) One, for instance, of those enumerated in Hag. <sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>b and <sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>b. A doubtful case of Rabbinical uncleanness is regarded<br>as clean even in a private domain.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Of the Tosef. Toh. IV cited.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) Rendered (supra <sup>4</sup>a) ‘an object of a minor degree of uncleanness’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Lev. XXVI, <sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>; the rt. of niddaf, and so also that of middaf implying something ‘light’, ‘of minor importance’,<br>hence a ‘minor degree of or Rabbinical uncleanness’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Having laid down that the period of uncleanness begins only ‘FROM THE TIME OF THEIR DISCOVERING OF<br>THE FLOW’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) I.e., made no restriction whatever against the possible infringement of the actual law.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Laying down that the period of uncleanness ‘IS TO BE RECKONED RETROSPECTIVELY FROM THE<br>PREVIOUS EXAMINATION’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Lit., ‘who broke through beyond his measures.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Lit., ‘on the first of the week’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Of course it is. Why then should such an obvious ruling have to be stated?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) A ruling that had to be enunciated, since otherwise it could have been argued that the flow began on the Sunday<br>immediately after the examination.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) As a kind of antithesis.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) For fixing a twenty-four hours’ period of uncleanness. The reason for Hillel's period, ‘from examination to<br>examination’ (cf. our Mishnah), is quite intelligible since the flow may well have begun as soon as the previous<br>examination was concluded, but the twenty-four hours’ period appears to have no logical justification whatsoever.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Any flow. Had it begun immediately after the conclusion of her previous examination she would have been aware<br>of it.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) That a woman is aware of the flow as soon as it begins.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) It being obvious that the flow began only at that moment, for if it had begun earlier she (cf. prev. n.) would have<br>been aware of the fact. Why then should her period of uncleanness extend backwards for twenty-four hours? An<br>objection against Rabbah.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) Sc., why did he take up such an untenable position?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) Lit., ‘to sharpen (the mind) of Abaye’. Rabbah advanced the reason merely to afford an opportunity for Abaye,<br>whose guardian and teacher he was, to prove it to be wrong.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Cf. p. <sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>. n. <sup>5</sup>.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) If a woman finds herself on examination to be clean it is thereby verified that all clean objects she handled during<br>the previous night are to be regarded as clean; and should she discover any flow later at the evening examination the<br>doubtful uncleanness would extend only to objects she handled during the day.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) Cf. prev. n. mut. mut.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) Spoken of in our Mishnah, and in the Baraitha cited.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) In defiance of the ordinance of the Rabbis.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) As a penalty.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) Lit., ‘a time’ or ‘a period’ of one day or night, sc. her uncleanness begins retrospectively one ‘onah earlier.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) Seeing that the uncleanness extends backwards for twenty-four hours which represent two ‘onahs.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) I.e., in addition to the ‘onah immediately preceding the one in which her last examination was held (during which<br>she is in any case unclean owing to the doubt as to when the flow began), she must suffer the penalty of being treated as<br>unclean retrospectively even during the ‘onah that preceded that one.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) When, for instance, the first examination after a number of days without an examination took place at midday. If the<br>uncleanness extended backwards for a period of twenty-four hours it would cover<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) the ‘onah of the day of the examination,<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) the ‘onah of the preceding night and<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) the ‘onah of the day preceding that night. Now since the penalty imposed was only one additional ‘onah why should<br>it in this case be increased to two ‘onahs? (<sup>1</sup>) Lit., ‘made their measures equal’, i.e., the period of twenty-four hours has<br>been fixed, irrespective of whether it covers two ‘onahs or three. (<sup>2</sup>) So Bah. Cur. edd. omit. (<sup>3</sup>) To the objection why in<br>the case mentioned (cf. supra p. <sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>, n. <sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) the uncleanness should extend over three ‘onahs.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) The woman who, not only failed to examine her body regularly in accordance with the ordinance of the Sages but<br>also delayed her last examination from the morning hour to noon.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) By having her period of uncleanness reduced to less than twenty-four hours.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) Over one in a similar position who held her examination in the early morning and whose period of uncleanness is<br>extended retrospectively for a full period of twenty-four hours to the previous morning.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup>) The two replies offered.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup>) According to the first reply she would be subject to uncleanness for a full period of twenty-four hours, while<br>according to the second reply, since in this case she is no sinner, the period would be reduced to two ‘onahs and her<br>uncleanness would be reckoned from the beginning of the previous evening only.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup>) What follows, with the exception of R. Dosa's ruling occurs also in the Mishnah infra <sup>7</sup>a.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>) I.e., one, whether married or unmarried, who suffered a flow for the first time in her life.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup>) Now, since the Rabbis elsewhere differ from R. Dosa's ruling, must it be conceded that our Mishnah represents his<br>view only?<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup>) As the appearance is obviously irregular it may well be suspected that one occurred earlier also.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘and the words of all’, those of the Rabbis as well those of R. Dosa.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup>) Since the dispute between R. Dosa and the Rabbis has been limited to a flow that did not occur at the set time.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup>) Sc. one on a garment of hers.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup>) From the time it had been washed.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup>) As in this case, despite the woman's settled period, the uncleanness is deemed to be retrospective so it is<br>retrospective in the case of the stain also.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup>) Since, from what has been said, it is only the Rabbis who impose retrospective uncleanness in the case of a woman<br>who, though having a settled period, suffered a flow before or after that time.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup>) Is it likely, however, that R. Dosa would differ from an anonymous Baraitha?<br>(<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup>) That the uncleanness is retrospective.",
        "while the Baraitha<sup>1</sup> is in agreement with both.<sup>2</sup> But why should not the final assumption be<sup>3</sup><br>reversed?<sup>4</sup> — As it is possible to adopt an explanation that leads to a relaxation of the law<sup>5</sup> and one<br>that leads to a restriction of it<sup>6</sup> we adopt the one that leads to the restriction.<br>Now it was just taught,<sup>7</sup> ‘For were she to observe a flow when it is not her set time she would be<br>unclean retrospectively for a period of twenty-four hours’ — [If this<sup>8</sup> is] the reason<sup>9</sup> [it follows] that<br>only in the case of a woman who has a settled period do the Rabbis draw a distinction between her<br>stain and her observation<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> [of a flow],<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> but in the case of the other women<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> concerning whom the<br>Sages ruled that it sufficed for them to reckon their uncleanness from the time they discovered the<br>flow<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> [the extent of the uncleanness of] their stains is like that of their observation of a flow.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> Now<br>whose view is this? — It is that of R. Hanina b. Antigonus; for Rab Judah citing Samuel who had it<br>from R. Hanina b. Antigonus stated, In the case of all women their stains cause uncleanness<br>retrospectively but in that of the women<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> concerning whom the Sages ruled that it sufficed for them<br>to reckon their uncleanness from the time they discovered the flow [the extent of the uncleanness of]<br>their stains is like that of their observation of a flow,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> the exception being a child who has not yet<br>attained the age of the suffering of a flow of whom, though her sheets are soiled with blood,<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> no<br>notice is to be taken.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> But does R. Hanina at all uphold<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> the law of the uncleanness of a stain?<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup><br>Was it not taught: In the case of all women their stains are unclean and also in the case of the women<br>concerning whom the Sages ruled that it sufficed for them to reckon their period of uncleanness from<br>the time they discovered the flow their stains are unclean; while R. Hanina b. Antigonus ruled, The<br>women concerning whom the Sages ruled that it sufficed for them to reckon their uncleanness from<br>the time they discovered the flow are not subject to the law of uncleanness of the stain? Now does<br>not this mean that they are not subject at all to the law of uncleanness of the stain?<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> — No, it means<br>that they are not subject to the law of the uncleanness of the stain retrospectively but they are well<br>subject to it from now<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> onwards. Does this<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> then imply that the first Tanna<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> is of the opinion that<br>their uncleanness is even retrospective? — Yes; it<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> being the view of R. Meir who restricts the law<br>in respect of stains. For it was taught: In the case of all women their stains are unclean<br>retrospectively and also in the case of the women concerning whom the Sages ruled that it sufficed<br>for them to reckon their period of uncleanness from the time they discovered the flow their stains are<br>unclean retrospectively; so R. Meir. R. Hanina b. Antigonus ruled, In the case of the women<br>concerning whom the Sages ruled that it sufficed for them to reckon their period of uncleanness from<br>the time they discovered the flow [the uncleanness of] their stains is like that of their observation [of<br>their flow]; and a child who has attained the age of suffering a flow is subject to the law of the<br>uncleanness of the stain while one who has not attained that age is not subject to the uncleanness of a<br>stain, and when does she attain the age of suffering a flow? When she attains her maidenhood.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup><br>AND IF A WOMAN USES TESTING-RAGS WHEN SHE HAS MARITAL INTERCOURSE<br>etc. Rab Judah citing Samuel ruled: A testing-rag used before<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> marital intercourse does not reduce<br>[the doubtful period<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> of retrospective uncleanness] as an examination. What is the reason? — R.<br>Kattina replied: Because the woman is in a hurry to do her marital duty.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> But what matters it even if<br>she is in a hurry to do her marital duty? — Since she is in a hurry to do it she does not insert the<br>testing-rag into depressions and folds.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup><br>We learnt: IF A WOMAN USES TESTING-RAGS WHEN SHE HAS MARITAL<br>INTERCOURSE, THIS IS INDEED LIKE AN EXAMINATION. Does not this mean that she uses<br>one before intercourse and one after it?<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> — No, the one as well as the other is used after intercourse<br>but<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> one is for the man<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> and the other is for her; as we learnt: It is the custom of the daughters of<br>Israel when having marital intercourse to use two testing-rags, one for the man and the other for<br>herself.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> What a comparison!<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> If you concede that one is used before intercourse and the other after<br>it one can well understand the necessity for the ruling.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> As it might have been presumed that on<br>account of her being in a hurry to do her marital duty she does not properly perform her test we were<br>informed that THIS IS INDEED LIKE AN EXAMINATION. If you maintain, however, that the one<br>testing-rag as well as the other is used after marital intercourse, is not the ruling obvious?<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> — It<br>might have been presumed [that the test should be ineffective]<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> on account of the possibility of the<br>appearance of a drop of blood of the size of a mustard seed<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> which semen might cover up,<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> hence<br>we were informed [that such a remote possibility need not be considered]. And if you prefer I might<br>reply: The Rabbis required a woman to perform two tests, one before intercourse and one after it,<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup><br>and in stating ‘THIS IS INDEED LIKE AN EXAMINATION’ the reference is to the one after the<br>intercourse. But was it not stated, IF A WOMAN USES etc.?<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> — Read: And a woman shall use.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup><br>LESSENS EITHER THE PERIOD OF THE PAST TWENTY-FOUR HOURS. Now that you<br>stated that it<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> lessens THE PERIOD OF THE PAST TWENTY-FOUR HOURS<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup><br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Just cited, dealing with the bloodstain.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Cf. supra n. <sup>3</sup>.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘and let him make it stand’.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) As has been suggested at first, that our Mishnah represents the view of the Rabbis as well as that of R. Dosa while<br>the Baraitha represents only that of the Rabbis.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) As has been previously suggested: That a flow at the set time causes no retrospective uncleanness in accordance with<br>the general opinion, while one occurring at any other time is subject to retrospective uncleanness only in accordance<br>with the view of the Rabbis.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) The one finally adopted: That a flow at the set time causes retrospective uncleanness according to the Rabbis at least,<br>while one at any other time causes retrospective uncleanness even according to R. Dosa.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) In the Baraitha supra <sup>4</sup>b ad fin.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) ‘For were she to observe etc.’.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Why a stain causes retrospective uncleanness, sc. though a stain cannot be subject to greater restrictions than a<br>discharge it causes uncleanness retrospectively, since a flow that occurred at any time other than the set time also causes<br>retrospective uncleanness.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) At the set time.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Sc. while in the latter case the uncleanness is not retrospective in the former, for the reason stated (cf. prev. n.) it is.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) The four classes, for instance, mentioned supra <sup>4</sup>b and infra <sup>7</sup>a.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) So that in their case the law of retrospective uncleanness never applies.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Sc. both are not retrospective.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) It being unknown whether it came from her body or from elsewhere.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) It being assumed, though the assumption might be most unlikely, that she passed through a butcher's market and<br>soiled her sheets there. In no case is it assumed that the blood came from her own body because the law of uncleanness,<br>as far as stains are concerned, is merely Rabbinical, and in the case of a minor no Rabbinical measure was enacted.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) In the case of the four classes of women mentioned.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Even after it had been discovered.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) How then could it be said supra that R.

        "was it also necessary to state that it lessens THE PERIOD FROM THE PREVIOUS<br>EXAMINATION TO THE LAST EXAMINATION?<sup>1</sup> — As it might have been presumed that only<br>in the case of the twenty-four hours’ period did the Rabbis<sup>2</sup> take into consideration the possible loss<br>of clean things<sup>3</sup> but not in that of the period from the previous examination to the last examination,<sup>4</sup><br>we were informed [that both periods are equally reduced].<br>HOW [IS ONE TO UNDERSTAND THE RULING THAT] ‘IT SUFFICES [TO RECKON HER<br>PERIOD OF UNCLEANNESS FROM] THE TIME SHE DISCOVERS THE FLOW’ etc. What<br>need was there<sup>5</sup> for stating, IF SHE WAS SITTING ON A BED AND WAS OCCUPIED WITH<br>RITUALLY CLEAN OBJECTS, when it should rather have been stated,<sup>6</sup> IF SHE WAS<br>OCCUPIED<sup>7</sup> WITH RITUALLY CLEAN OBJECTS AND HAVING LEFT THEM, OBSERVED A<br>FLOW? — It is this that we were informed:<sup>8</sup> The reason [why the bed is regarded as clean is]<br>because [in the case of that woman]<sup>9</sup> it suffices [for her to reckon] her [period of uncleanness from<br>the] time [of her discovery of the flow] but<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> [where the uncleanness extends backwards over]<br>twenty-four hours the bed also is regarded as unclean.<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> This provides support for Ze'iri, for Ze'iri<br>ruled: [A woman<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> during] the twenty-four hours preceding her discovery of a menstrual flow causes<br>bed and seat<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> to convey uncleanness to a man who in turn conveys it to his clothes.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> But consider:<br>This bed is a thing that has no sense to answer questions,<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> and is not doubtful uncleanness<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> in the<br>case of an object that has no sense to answer questions regarded as clean?<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> Ze'iri explained: [This<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup><br>refers to a case] where her friends were carrying her in the bed so that the latter may be regarded as<br>the hand of her friends.<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> Now, however, that R.

R. Simeon b.

Glos.)<br>who is able to answer questions.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) The ruling in our Mishnah, which does regard (by implication) the bed on which the woman sat as unclean.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) The hand, being part of a human being who is well able to answer questions, is justly compared to the sotah whose<br>doubtful uncleanness is regarded as unclean. It is for a similar reason (that things handled by a human being are regarded<br>as his hand), it may be added, that the things the woman handled when sitting on the bed are regarded as unclean even<br>where the bed was resting on the ground, and this explains why the objection supra was raised in connection with the<br>bed and not in connection with the things the woman has handled.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) As in that of the bed and the menstruant during the twenty-four hours preceding the observation of the flow or in<br>that of a dead creeping thing that was carried by a man and a doubt arose as to whether it came in contact with a certain<br>clean object.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Since the uncleanness, if any, was brought to it by a human agency.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) And in a private domain is regarded as unclean. Only when the inanimate object in doubt was near an unclean one<br>that was also inanimate, and ‘no human agency was involved, is it regarded as clean.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) V. p. <sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>, n. <sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Supra q.v. notes.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) He being either unclean (in the former case) or clean (in the latter one).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Between the cloak and the objects in its vicinity.

An object touched by a menstruant assumes only the status of a first grade<br>of uncleanness which conveys uncleanness to objects but not to a human being.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) The answer apparently being in the affirmative, the difficulty arises: How could Ze'iri maintain that the woman<br>causes bed and seat to convey uncleanness to a man who in turn etc.’?<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup>) Which seems to reduce the uncleanness of the bed and seat of the menstruant in question to a lower degree than that<br>of earthenware.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup>) Only when uncovered does it contract uncleanness (cf.

R. Akiba<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> ruled: She conveys uncleanness to the man who<br>cohabited with her but begins her counting<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> from the time only of her observing a flow.

And if he did not hear of the Baraitha, whence did he<br>[derive the law for his inference] a minori ad majus? — The fact is that he heard of the Baraitha,<br>but<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> were he to derive his ruling from the Baraitha it could have been objected [that the<br>uncleanness<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> is conveyed] either to the man or to his clothes<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> but not to the man as well as to the<br>clothes he wears,<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> hence he had recourse to his inference a minori ad majus.<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup><br>R.

Asheri a.l.).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) Who (supra <sup>5</sup>b ad fin.) took the law of the uncleanness of an earthen vessel for granted and deduced from it that of<br>the bed.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) That was just cited, in which the law of the earthen vessel is explicitly enunciated.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) As to the reason why he did not quote it.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) Of the bed or seat.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Whichever of them came in contact with the unclean object.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) Which did not come in direct contact with the seat or the bed.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) From an earthenware vessel.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) In Hag. <sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>b where are enumerated the restrictions that are applicable to hallowed things and not to terumah and vice<br>versa.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) Such as that of the twenty-four hours’ period under discussion where the uncleanness is merely a preventive<br>measure.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) Supra, in the Baraitha last cited.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) ‘Foodstuffs and drinks’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) The oil of a meal-offering, for instance, or the wine of libation.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) Lit., ‘at the time of their passing away from eating’.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) Infra <sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>a.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) Lit., ‘what has been, has been’, sc. what is the use of an examination after the meal has been consumed when<br>nothing can be done even if the woman were to be found unclean.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) The examination.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) Should a woman, for instance, discover a flow later in the day the examination after her morning meal would ensure<br>the cleanness of the terumah that remained from that meal. Thus it follows that in the absence of an examination the<br>terumah would be deemed to be unclean retrospectively. How, then, could R. Huna maintain that the uncleanness is<br>conveyed to hallowed things only?<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) In place of R. Hisda's version of R. Judah's meaning.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) Sc., if she finds herself on examination to be unclean the remnants of her meal, since she touched them, are deemed<br>to be unclean and, as unclean terumah must be burned.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) Heb. Keshi'ur weseth (v. Rashi). Evthion (Tosaf. Asheri) **, ‘forthwith’ (cf. Jast.).<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup>) So that it may be taken for granted that the terumah she had just handled had come in contact with a confirmed<br>menstruant. Where, however, the woman held no examination immediately after her meal, a subsequent discovery of a<br>place causes no retrospective uncleanness to the terumah she handled.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup>) In the case of a young woman who did not suffer a flow during three consecutive periods (of thirty days each).<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup>) That the period of uncleanness is to be reckoned from the discovery of the flow and not retrospectively. The Rabbis<br>who differ from R. Eliezer hold this ruling to apply to an old woman only (whose senility might be assumed to be the<br>cause of the irregularity) but not to a young one (cf. prev. n.).<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>) This is discussed presently.",
        "in an emergency’.<sup>1</sup> And the point was raised, What could be the meaning of ‘after he reminded<br>himself’? If it be explained, ‘After he remembered that the halachah was not in agreement with R.<br>Eliezer but in agreement with the Rabbis’, [the difficulty would arise:] How could he act according<br>to the former's ruling<sup>2</sup> even in an emergency? Hence,<sup>3</sup> [it means after he recalled] that it was not<br>stated whether the law was in agreement with the one Master or with the other Master, and having<br>recalled that it was not an individual that differed from him<sup>4</sup> but that many differ from him he<br>observed, ‘R. Eliezer deserves to be relied upon in an emergency’.<sup>1</sup> Now if it is granted [that<br>retrospective uncleanness applies also] to terumah<sup>5</sup> one can well understand the incident<sup>6</sup> since<br>terumah was in existence in the days of Rabbi, but if it is maintained [that retrospective uncleanness<br>is applicable only] to hallowed things<sup>7</sup> [the objection would arise:] Were there hallowed things in the<br>days of Rabbi?<sup>8</sup> — [This may be explained] on the lines of a statement of ‘Ullah. As ‘Ulla stated,<br>‘The Associates’<sup>9</sup> in Galilee<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> keep their things<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> in levitical cleanness’;<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> so they may have done it<br>in the days of Rabbi.<br>Come and hear: It once happened that R.

After the last one when<br>she held the examination she found herself to be unclean and she came and asked R. Gamaliel who<br>told her that they were all unclean.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> ‘Master’, she said to him, ‘did I not hold an examination after<br>each one’?<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> ‘If so’, he told her, ‘the last<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> is unclean<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> while all the others are clean’. At all events<br>was it not here stated, ‘bread loaves of terumah’?<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> — By terumah was meant<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> the bread loaves<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> of<br>a thanksgiving-offering.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> But how does it come about that the loaves of a thanksgiving-offering<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup><br>should require to be baked?<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> This is a case where they<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> were set aside<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> while they were being<br>kneaded,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> this being in line with what R.

[For when] the objection was<br>raised, ‘Do we not require forty loaves’,<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> [the reply was that] this<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> is just a religious requirement.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup><br>But, surely, [it was asked,] is it not necessary to separate terumah<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> from each?<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> And should you<br>reply that one might break off a piece from each<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> [it could be retorted that:] The All Merciful said,<br>one<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> which implies that one must not break off a piece.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> [To this] it was replied that ‘they were set<br>aside while they were being kneaded’;<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> so here also<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> it may be explained that they were separated<br>while they were being kneaded.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup><br>Come and hear: Another incident took place when R.

Now if it is conceded that one<br>incident<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> concerned hallowed things and the other terumah, it can be well understood why she<br>asked a second time, but if it is contended that the former as well as the latter concerned hallowed<br>things, why should she have asked him a second time? — [Each] incident occurred with a different<br>maid.<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup><br>Another version: R. Huna ruled, [The retrospective uncleanness during] the twenty-four hours<br>[preceding the observation] of a menstrual flow is conveyed both to hallowed things and to terumah.<br>Whence is this<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> inferred? From its omission in the enumeration of<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> the various grades [of<br>sanctity].<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> Said R. Nahman to him: Surely, a Tanna<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> recited [that the retrospective uncleanness]<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup><br>applies only to hallowed things and not to terumah. R. Samuel son of R. Isaac accepted this<br>[teaching]<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> from him [and explained it] as applying to common food that was prepared under<br>conditions of hallowed things and not to common food that was prepared in conditions of terumah.<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup><br>We learnt elsewhere: If a question of doubtful uncleanness has arisen about a dough<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> before it was<br>rolled<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> it may be prepared in uncleanness,<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> [but if the doubt has arisen] after it had been rolled<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> it<br>must be prepared in cleanness.<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> ‘Before it was rolled it may be prepared in uncleanness’, because it<br>is common food and it is permitted to cause uncleanness to common food in Erez Israel. ‘After it had<br>been rolled it must be prepared in cleanness’, because common food that is in a condition of tebel<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup><br>in respect of the dough-offering is regarded as dough-offering, and it is forbidden to cause<br>uncleanness to the dough-offering.

It was taught: R. Eliezer said to R. Joshua, ‘You have not heard<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> but<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> I have heard;<br>you have only heard one tradition but I have heard many;<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> people do not ask him who has not seen<br>the new moon to come and tender evidence<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> but only him who has seen it.’ Throughout the lifetime<br>of<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> R. Eliezer the people acted in accordance with the ruling of R. Joshua, but after the passing<br>away of R. Eliezer, R. Joshua re-introduced the earlier practice.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> Why did he<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> not follow R. Eliezer<br>during his lifetime? — Because R. Eliezer was a disciple of Shammai<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> and he<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> felt that if they<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup><br>would act in agreement with his ruling in one matter<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> they<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> would act in agreement with his rulings<br>in other matters also<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> and that out of respect for R. Eliezer no one could interfere<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> with them; but<br>after the passing away of R. Eliezer, when the people<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> could well be interfered with, he<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup><br>re-introduced the original practice.<br>Rab Judah citing Samuel ruled: The halachah is in agreement with R. Eliezer in four cases. One is<br>that which has just been mentioned.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> The other is that about a woman who was in a hard travail<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup><br>[concerning whom it was stated:] For how long must she be relieved from pain<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> so as to be regarded<br>a zabah?<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> Twenty-four hours;<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> so R. Eliezer.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> And the halachah is in agreement with his view.<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup><br>And the third<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> is the following: If a zab and a zabah<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> examined themselves on the first day<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> and<br>found themselves clean and on the seventh day also<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> and found themselves clean, but did not<br>examine themselves during the other days,<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> R. Eliezer ruled: Behold these<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> are in a presumptive<br>condition of cleanness,<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> and R. Joshua ruled: They are entitled [to reckon as clean] only the first<br>day and the seventh day,<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> while R. Akiba ruled: They are entitled [to reckon as clean] the seventh<br>day alone,<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> and it was taught: R. Simeon and R. Jose stated, ‘The view of R. Eliezer<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> is more<br>feasible than that of R. Joshua,<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> while that of R. Akiba is more feasible than those of both,<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> but the<br>halachah agrees with that of R. Eliezer’.<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> And the fourth is the following.<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> For we have learnt: If<br>the outer sides<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> of vessels were rendered unclean<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> by liquids,<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> R. Eliezer ruled, they convey<br>uncleanness<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> to other liquids<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> but they<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> do not render foodstuffs unfit.<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> ‘They convey<br>uncleanness to liquids’ even where the latter are common, but they ‘do not render foodstuffs unfit’,<br>even where the latter are terumah. R. Joshua ruled: They convey uncleanness to liquids and also<br>render foodstuffs unfit.<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> Said R. Joshua: This may be inferred a minori ad majus: If a tebul yom<br>who<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> does not convey uncleanness to a common liquid,<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> nevertheless renders foodstuffs of<br>terumah unfit how much more then should the outsides of vessels which do convey uncleanness to<br>an unconsecrated liquid render foodstuffs of terumah unfit. And R. Eliezer?<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> — The uncleanness of<br>the outsides of vessels<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> is only Rabbinical<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> while that of a tebul yom<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> is pentateuchal;<sup>6</sup><sup>4</sup> and,<br>where it is a question of deducing a Rabbinical from a Pentateuchal law, no inference a minori ad<br>majus can be applied.<sup>6</sup><sup>5</sup> For in accordance with Pentateuchal law no foodstuff conveys uncleanness<br>to a vessel and no liquid conveys uncleanness to a vessel, and it is only the Rabbis that have<br>ordained such uncleanness as a preventive measure against possible laxity in the case of the fluid<sup>6</sup><sup>6</sup><br>of a zab or a zabah;<sup>6</sup><sup>7</sup> hence it is only in the case of liquids, which are prone to contract uncleanness,<br>that the Rabbis have enacted a preventive measure, but in that of foodstuffs, since they are not prone<br>to contract uncleanness, the Rabbis enacted no preventive measure. What, however, is the reason for<br>the mention of the outsides of vessels?<sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup> — Because their restrictions are lighter.<sup>6</sup><sup>9</sup> For we have<br>learnt: If the outside of a vessel came in contact with unclean liquids,<sup>7</sup><sup>0</sup> its outside becomes unclean<br>while its inside, its hanger,<sup>7</sup><sup>1</sup> its rim and its handles remain clean, but if its inside has become<br>unclean all of it is unclean.<sup>7</sup><sup>2</sup><br>But what does Samuel teach us,<sup>7</sup><sup>3</sup> seeing that in all these cases we learnt that the law [was in<br>agreement with R. Eliezer]? And should you reply that he mainly informed us about the ‘outsides of<br>vessels’ concerning which we did not learn [elsewhere what the law was], why [it could be retorted]<br>did he not simply state, ‘The halachah is in agreement with R. Eliezer in the case of the outsides of<br>vessels’? — The fact is that it is this that he informed us:<sup>7</sup><sup>4</sup> That the halachah may not be derived<br>from a theoretical statement.<sup>7</sup><sup>5</sup><br>But are there no more [than the four rulings]?<sup>7</sup><sup>6</sup> Is there not in fact another, since we have learnt:<br>R. Eliezer ruled,<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Preceding the time of her observation of the flow.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) During the twenty-four months after the child's birth throughout which she is expected to suckle it (v. Gemara infra).<br>(<sup>3</sup>) ‘Periods’. This is explained in the Gemara infra.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Without her observing of a flow.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) This is explained in the Gemara infra.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Var. lec., ‘Eleazar’.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Even a young one.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Without her observing of a flow.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) If three consecutive ‘onahs, however, have not passed, there applies the law of retrospective uncleanness, contrary to<br>the view of R. Eliezer and the first Tanna supra.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) The Rabbis, supra.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) So Bah. Cur. edd. ‘he spoke’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Supra in the case of the CLASSES OF WOMEN. This is discussed in the Gemara infra.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) After the three ‘onahs have passed over the virgin, the woman in pregnancy or the old woman.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Lit., ‘at the second’, since her natural proneness to the flow is re-established.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) So that it cannot be ascribed to the woman's natural disposition (cf. prev. n.).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Cf.

Eliezer.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) R. Joshua.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) So R. Tam and Rashb. (contra Rashi who, referring to B.M. <sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup>b, renders shamuthi ‘one placed under the ban’).<br>Wherever Beth Hillel differed from Beth Shammai the law (with a very few exceptions) is always in agreement with the<br>former.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) R.

If the discharge was not due to the travail she, having observed the blood on three consecutive days, would be<br>subject to the restrictions of a zabah; but if it was due to travail she would be exempt from these restrictions. If a zabah<br>she would have to count after childbirth seven days (as a zabah) in addition to the number of days prescribed for a<br>woman after childbirth, and she would also have to bring two sacrifices one as a zabah and the other as one after<br>childbirth.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) After the three days mentioned (cf. prev. n.) and before the birth of the child.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) Retrospectively, on account of the discharges on the three days. If the pain had continued until delivery it would<br>have been obvious that the discharge on the three days mentioned was also due to the same cause, but if it ceased some<br>considerable time before birth it may well be concluded that that discharge had no connection with the childbearing and<br>the woman would consequently come within the category of zabah (cf. prev. n. but one).<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) If such a period has intervened it is obvious that the discharge mentioned was in no way due to travail.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) Infra <sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>b.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) Though R.

As the cleanness of the intermediate days is a matter of doubt they must count another five days<br>to make up the prescribed number of seven. In the case of a certain discharge on any of the days all the prescribed seven<br>days must, of course, be counted all over again.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) Infra <sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup>b; since it is possible that there was a discharge on the sixth day, when there was no examination (cf. prev.<br>n. last clause).<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) Who is consistent in disregarding completely the possibility of a discharge on any of the five days that intervened<br>between the first and last clean ones.

The latter being a primary uncleanness causes the<br>liquids to be an uncleanness of the first grade which (though Pentateuchally, since their uncleanness is not a primary one,<br>it cannot, as explained in Pes. <sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>a, convey uncleanness to vessels) renders the vessels unclean Rabbinically. As the<br>uncleanness that is conveyed to vessels by liquids is merely Rabbinical, and as it was desired to make a distinction<br>between Pentateuchal and Rabbinical uncleanness, it was enacted that, in such a case, only the outsides of vessels and<br>not their insides shall contract the uncleanness.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup>) Because liquids are prone to uncleanness. In consequence they contract from the vessels a first grade of<br>uncleanness, the same grade as that of the outer sides of the vessels themselves.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup>) Since Pentateuchally (cf. prev. n. but one) they are deemed to be clean.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup>) Toh.

Lev. XV, <sup>8</sup>).<br>(<sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup>) Lit., ‘wherein is the difference . . . that he took up’, sc. why should not the Mishnah equally speak of the insides of<br>vessels that similarly contracted from liquids Rabbinical uncleanness?<br>(<sup>6</sup><sup>9</sup>) Than those that govern the insides of vessels. In the latter case R. Eliezer agrees that terumah is rendered invalid.<br>(<sup>7</sup><sup>0</sup>) Lit., ‘a vessel whose back became unclean by liquids’.<br>(<sup>7</sup><sup>1</sup>) Lit., ‘its ear’.<br>(<sup>7</sup><sup>2</sup>) Kelim XXV, <sup>6</sup>.<br>(<sup>7</sup><sup>3</sup>) By stating supra that ‘the halachah is in agreement with R.

All statements as to what is the halachah added by a Tanna to a ruling in a Mishnah or a<br>Baraitha must be regarded as a mere opinion or theory which a disciple expressed with reference to a ruling of his<br>master. It is only the carefully considered decisions of the later Amoras that, being based on a minute examination and<br>thorough analysis of their predecessor's views that may be relied upon as authoritative in determining the halachah (cf.<br>Rashi).<br>(<sup>7</sup><sup>6</sup>) Referred to supra by Rab Judah in the name of Samuel, concerning which the halachah is in agreement with R.<br>Eliezer.",

Eliezer’?<sup>4</sup> — When Samuel<br>stated ‘the halachah is in agreement with R. Eliezer in four cases he referred to rulings in the Order<br>of Toharoth,<sup>5</sup> but in the other Orders there are many such rulings. This<sup>6</sup> also stands to reason, for we<br>learnt: R. Eliezer ruled, Also in the case of one who shovels out loaves of bread<sup>7</sup> from an oven and<br>puts them into a basket,<sup>8</sup> the basket causes them to be combined in respect of their liability to the<br>dough-offering’,<sup>9</sup> and in connection with this Rab Judah citing Samuel stated, ‘The halachah is in<br>agreement with R.

But why is the latter<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> a more valid proof<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> than the<br>former?<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> — Because in the former case R. Eleazar takes up the same standpoint as he,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> for we<br>learnt: R.

Judah b. Baba takes up the same<br>position as he,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> for we learnt,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> ‘R. Judah b.

In<br>accordance with the laws of the levirate marriage the surviving brother must marry the widow, but such marriage cannot<br>take place in this case on account of the prohibition to marry a wife's sister. The minor, furthermore, is now forbidden to<br>live with her husband (whose marriage with her is only Rabbinically valid) on account of the levirate bond between him<br>and her sister (which is Pentateuchal).

        "But was he<sup>1</sup> not much older than he?<sup>2</sup> — Rather say:<sup>3</sup> Because R. Hanina b.

Was it not in fact taught: On the night of the Day of<br>Atonement<sup>6</sup> one recites in his prayers seven benedictions and makes confession; in the morning<sup>6</sup> one<br>recites seven benedictions and makes confession; during the additional prayer<sup>7</sup> one recites seven<br>benedictions and makes confession; in the afternoon prayer one recites seven benedictions and<br>makes confession; In the concluding prayer<sup>8</sup> one recites seven benedictions and makes confession,<br>and in the evening<sup>9</sup> one recites seven benedictions embodying the substance of the Eighteen;<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> and<br>R. Hanina b. Gamaliel in the name of his ancestors ruled: One must recite in his prayers<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> all the<br>eighteen benedictions because it is necessary to include habdalah<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> in ‘who favourest man with<br>knowledge’?<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> — R. Nahman b. Isaac replied: He cited it<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> in the name of his ancestors but he<br>himself<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> does not uphold it.<br>Said R. Jeremiah to R. Zera:<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> But do you not yourself hold that he who taught that balsam was a<br>fruit is R. Eliezer, seeing that we have learnt: R. Eliezer ruled, Milk curdled with the sap of ‘orlah is<br>forbidden?<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> — This<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> might be said to agree even with the view of the Rabbis, since they differed<br>from R. Eliezer only in respect of the sap of the tree but in the case of the sap of the fruit they agree<br>with him, for we have learnt: R. Joshua stated, I have explicitly heard that milk curdled with the sap<br>of the leaves or with the sap of the roots is permitted, but if it was curdled with the sap of unripe figs<br>it is forbidden because the latter is regarded as a proper fruit.<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> And if you prefer I might reply: The<br>Rabbis differ from R. Eliezer only in respect of a fruit producing tree but in the case of a tree that<br>does not produce fruit they agree that its sap is regarded as its fruit, for we have learnt: R. Simeon<br>ruled, Balsam is not subject to the laws of the Sabbatical Year<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> and the Sages ruled, Balsam is<br>subject to the laws of the Sabbatical Year because the sap of the tree is regarded as its fruit.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> Now<br>who are the Sages? Are they not in fact the Rabbis who differ<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> from R. Eliezer?<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> — Thus, a certain<br>elder replied to him, said R. Johanan, ‘Who are the \"Sages\"? R. Eliezer who ruled that its balsam is<br>its fruit’. But if by the ‘Sages’ R. Eliezer was meant what was the point in speaking of a tree that<br>does not produce fruit seeing that even where a tree produces fruit its sap is regarded as its fruit? —<br>He<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> spoke to them<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> according to the view of the Rabbis. ‘According to my view’ [he said in<br>effect,] ‘even in the case of a fruit producing tree its sap is regarded as its fruit, but according to your<br>view<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> agree with me at least in this case of a tree that produces no fruit that its sap is its fruit. But<br>the Rabbis told him: No difference is made.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup><br>WHO IS REGARDED AS A ‘VIRGIN’? ANY WOMAN WHO HAS NOT YET OBSERVED<br>etc. Our Rabbis taught: [If a virgin] married and observed a discharge of blood that was due to the<br>marriage, or if when she bore a child she observed a discharge of blood that was due to the birth, she<br>is still called a ‘virgin’, because the virgin of whom the Rabbis spoke is one that is a virgin as<br>regards menstrual blood but not one who is so in regard to the blood of virginity.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> Can this,<br>however, be correct?<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> Has not R. Kahana in fact stated, ‘A Tanna taught: There are three kinds of<br>virgin, the human virgin, the soil virgin and the sycamore virgin. The \"human virgin\" is one that<br>never<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> had any sexual intercourse, the practical issue<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> being her eligibility to marry a High Priest<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup><br>or else her claim to a kethubah of two hundred zuz;<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> the \"virgin soil\" is one that had never<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> been<br>cultivated, the practical issue<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> being its designation as \"a rough valley\"<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> or else its legal status as<br>regards purchase and sale;<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> the \"virgin sycamore\" is one that has never<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> been cut,<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> the practical<br>issue<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> being its legal status as regards purchase and sale<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> or else the permissibility to cut it<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> in the<br>Sabbatical Year, as we have learnt: A virgin sycamore may not be cut in the Sabbatical Year because<br>such cutting is regarded as cultivation’.<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> Now if this<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> were correct why did he<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> not mention this<br>one also? — R. Nahman b. Isaac replied: He only mentioned such as has no special<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> name<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> but one<br>which bears a special<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> name<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> he does not mention. R. Shesheth son of R. Idi replied: He<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> only<br>mentioned those, the loss of whose virginity<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> is dependent on an act<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> but one the loss of whose<br>virginity<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> is not dependent on an act<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> he does not mention. R. Hanina son of R. Ika replied: He<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup><br>only mentioned those<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> which do not change<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> into their original condition<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> but one which does<br>change to its original condition<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> he does not mention. Rabina replied: He<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> only mentioned that to<br>which a purchaser is likely to object<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> but that to which a purchaser is not likely to object<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> he does<br>not mention. But do not people object?<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> Was it not in fact taught, ‘R. Hiyya stated: As leaven is<br>wholesome for the dough so is menstrual blood wholesome for a woman’<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> and it was also taught in<br>the name of R. Meir, ‘Every woman who has an abundance of menstrual blood has many<br>children’?<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> — Rather say: He<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> only mentioned that which a purchaser is anxious to acquire<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> but<br>that<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> which a purchaser is not anxious to acquire<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> he does not mention.<br>Our Rabbis taught: What is meant by a virgin soil? One which<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> turns up clods<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> and whose earth<br>is not loose. If<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> a potsherd is found in it, it may be known that it had once been cultivated;<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> if flint,<br>it is undoubtedly<sup>6</sup><sup>4</sup> virgin soil.<br>‘A WOMAN IN PREGNANCY’? ONE WHOSE EMBRYO ‘CAN BE DISCERNED. At what<br>stage<sup>6</sup><sup>5</sup> is the embryo discernible? — Symmachus citing R. Meir replied: Three months after<br>conception. And though there is no actual proof for this statement there is an allusion<sup>6</sup><sup>6</sup> to it, for it is<br>said in Scripture, And it came to pass about three months after<sup>6</sup><sup>7</sup> etc. ‘An allusion to it’ [you say], is<br>not this a text of Scripture and a most reliable<sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup> proof? — [It can only be regarded as an allusion]<br>because some women<sup>6</sup><sup>9</sup> give birth after nine months and others after seven months.<sup>7</sup><sup>0</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: If a woman was<sup>7</sup><sup>1</sup> in a condition of presumptive pregnancy and after observing<br>a discharge of blood she miscarried an inflated object<sup>7</sup><sup>2</sup> or any other object which had no vitality<sup>7</sup><sup>3</sup><br>she<sup>7</sup><sup>4</sup> is still deemed to be<sup>7</sup><sup>5</sup> in the condition of her presumptive pregnancy and it suffices for her to<br>reckon her period of menstrual uncleanness from the time of her observation of the discharge.<sup>7</sup><sup>6</sup> And<br>though there is no actual proof for this ruling<sup>7</sup><sup>7</sup> there is an allusion<sup>7</sup><sup>8</sup> to it, for it is said in Scripture,<br>We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind.<sup>7</sup><sup>9</sup> But why<br>only ‘an allusion to it’ seeing that the text provides actual<sup>8</sup><sup>0</sup> proof? — That text was in fact written<br>about males.<sup>8</sup><sup>1</sup><br>I would, however, point out an incongruity: If a woman was in hard labour<sup>8</sup><sup>2</sup> for two days<sup>8</sup><sup>3</sup> and<br>on the third day<sup>8</sup><sup>4</sup> she miscarried an inflated object or any thing that had no vitality, she<sup>8</sup><sup>5</sup> is regarded<br>as bearing in the condition of a zabah.<sup>8</sup><sup>6</sup> Now if you maintain that such miscarriage is a proper birth<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) R.

        "did not the All Merciful [it may be objected] ordain that [a flow of blood in] painful labour<br>immediately before birth<sup>1</sup> is regarded as clean?<sup>2</sup> — R. Papi replied: Leave alone the question of the<br>twenty-four hours retrospective uncleanness<sup>3</sup> which only involves a Rabbinical enactment.<sup>4</sup> R. Papa<br>replied: The actual reason<sup>5</sup> is that the woman<sup>6</sup> feels a heaviness in her head and limbs;<sup>7</sup> well then,<br>here also<sup>8</sup> she feels a heaviness in her head and in her limbs.<sup>9</sup><br>R. Jeremiah enquired of R. Zera: What is the ruling<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> where a woman observed a flow and<br>immediately after her pregnancy was discerned? Is she retrospectively unclean because her<br>pregnancy was not known at the time she observed the flow or is she not retrospectively unclean<br>since she observed it immediately before she became aware of her pregnancy? — The other replied:<br>The sole reason<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> is that she<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> feels a heaviness in her head and limbs<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> but<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> at the time she<br>observed the flow she felt no heaviness either in her head or in her limbs.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup><br>A certain old man asked R. Johanan: ‘What is the ruling if, when the time of her fixed period had<br>come during the days of her pregnancy and she did not examine herself? I am raising this question<br>on the view of the authority who laid down [that a woman's duty to hold an examination on the<br>arrival of her] fixed periods is an ordinance of the Torah.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> What is the ruling [I ask]? Must she<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup><br>examine herself since [the duty of holding an examination on the arrival of] the fixed periods is an<br>ordinance of the Torah<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> or is it possible that since<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> her menstrual blood is suspended,<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> she<br>requires no examination’?<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> — The other<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> replied, You have learnt it: R. Meir ruled, If a woman<br>was in a hiding-place<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> when the time of her fixed period arrived and she did not examine herself she<br>is nevertheless clean because fear suspends the menstrual flow.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> Now the reason is<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> that there was<br>fear, but if there had been no fear and the time of her fixed period had arrived and she did not<br>examine herself she would have been deemed unclean. It is thus clear<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> [that a woman's duty to<br>examine herself at the time of the arrival of her] fixed periods is an ordinance of the Torah and that,<br>nevertheless, since there was fear, her menstrual blood is deemed to be suspended and she requires<br>no exemption; so also here,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> since her menstrual blood is suspended she requires no examination.<br>‘A NURSING WOMAN’? A WOMAN BEFORE SHE HAS WEANED etc. Our Rabbis taught: A<br>nursing mother whose child died within twenty-four months<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> is in exactly the same position as all<br>other women<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> and causes retrospective uncleanness for a period of twenty-four hours or from the<br>previous to the last examination. If, therefore,<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> she continued to suck it for four or five years it<br>suffices for her to reckon her period of uncleanness from the time she has observed the flow; so R.<br>Meir. R. Judah, R. Jose and R. Simeon ruled: Only during the twenty-four months<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> does it suffice<br>for women to reckon their uncleanness from the time they have observed a flow.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> Therefore,<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> even<br>if she suckled it for four or five years she causes uncleanness retrospectively for twenty-four hours<br>or from the previous to the last examination.<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> Now if you will carefully consider [the views just<br>expressed] you will find that<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> according to the view of R. Meir the menstrual blood is decomposed<br>and turns into milk while according to the view of R. Jose, R. Judah and R. Simeon the woman's<br>limbs<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> are disjointed and her natural vigour<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> does not return before the lapse of twenty-four<br>months. Why the necessity for the ‘therefore’<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> of R. Meir?<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> — On account of the ‘therefore’<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> of<br>R. Jose. But why the necessity for the ‘therefore’ of R. Jose?<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> — It might have been assumed that<br>R. Jose maintains that<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> there are two [causes];<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> hence we were informed<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> [that he upholds the one<br>cause only].<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> So it was also taught: The menstrual blood<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> is decomposed and turns into milk; so R.<br>Meir. R. Jose stated: Her limbs<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> are disjointed and her natural strength does not return before<br>twenty-four months.<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> R. Elai explained: What is R. Meir's reason?<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> That it is written, Who can<br>bring a clean thing<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> from out of an unclean?<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> Is it not the Only One?<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> And the Rabbis?<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> — R.<br>Johanan replied: The reference<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> is to semen which is unclean, while the man who is created from it<br>is clean; and R. Eleazar replied: The reference<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> is to the water of sprinkling<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> in the case of which<br>the man who sprinkles it as well as the man upon whom it is sprinkled is clean while he who touches<br>it is unclean. But is the man who sprinkles it clean? Is it not in fact written, And he that sprinkleth<br>the water of sprinkling shall wash his clothes?<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> — What is meant by ‘He that sprinkleth’? He that<br>touches it. But is it not actually written, ‘He that sprinkleth’<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> and also ‘He that toucheth’?<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup><br>Furthermore, is not ‘He that sprinkleth’ required to wash his clothes<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> while ‘He that toucheth’ is not<br>required to do so?<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> — Rather say: What is meant by ‘He that sprinkleth’? He that carries.<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> Then<br>why was it not written, ‘He that carries’? — We were informed<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> that uncleanness is not contracted<br>unless one carried the minimum quantity prescribed for sprinkling. This is a satisfactory explanation<br>according to him who holds<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> that sprinkling must be performed with a prescribed minimum of the<br>water<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> . What, however, can be said according to him who holds that no prescribed minimum is<br>required?<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> — Even according to him who holds that no prescribed quantity is required the ruling<br>refers only to the quantity applied to the body of the man but as regards that which is in the vessel a<br>prescribed quantity is required; as we have learnt: What must be the quantity of water<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> that it shall<br>suffice for a sprinkling? As much as suffices for both the dipping therein of the tops of the stalks and<br>for the sprinkling.<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> It is, in fact, in view of such laws<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> that Solomon observed, I said: ‘I will get<br>wisdom’; but it was far from me.<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup><br>WHO IS REGARDED ‘AN OLD WOMAN’? ANY WOMAN OVER WHOM THREE ONAHS<br>HAVE PASSED NEAR THE TIME OF HER OLD AGE. What is to be understood by NEAR THE<br>TIME OF HER OLD AGE? — Rab Judah replied: The age when her women friends speak of her as<br>an old woman; and R. Simeon<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> replied:<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) The woman having had no relief from her pain between the appearance of the flow and birth (cf. prev. n. but one).<br>(<sup>2</sup>) V. infra <sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>b.

        "when people call her mother in her presence<sup>1</sup> and she does not blush. R. Zera and R. Samuel b. Isaac<br>differ:<sup>2</sup> One says, ‘[When she is called mother] and<sup>3</sup> she does not mind,’ and the other says, ‘And<sup>3</sup><br>she does not blush’ — What is the practical difference between them? — The practical difference<br>between them is the case of one who blushes but does not mind.<br>What is the length of an ‘onah? — Resh Lakish citing R. Judah Nesi'ah<sup>4</sup> replied: A normal ‘onah<br>is thirty days; but Raba, citing R. Hisda, replied: Twenty days. In fact, however, there is no<br>difference of opinion between them. One Master<sup>5</sup> reckons both the clean and the unclean days<sup>6</sup> while<br>the other Master<sup>7</sup> does not reckon the unclean days.<sup>8</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: If over an old woman have passed three ‘onahs<sup>9</sup> and then she observed a flow,<br>it suffices for her to reckon her period of uncleanness from the time she observed the flow; if another<br>three ‘onahs have passed<sup>9</sup> and then she observed a flow, it again suffices for her to reckon her<br>uncleanness from the time she observed it. If, however, another three ‘onahs have passed<sup>9</sup> and then<br>she observed a flow she is regarded<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> as all other women and causes uncleanness retrospectively for<br>twenty-four hours or from the previous examination to the last examination. This<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> is the case not<br>only<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> where she observed the flow at perfectly regular intervals<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> but even where she observed it at<br>successively decreasing intervals or<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> increasing intervals.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> [You say,] ‘Even<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> where she observed<br>it at successively decreasing intervals’. It thus follows<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> that there is no need to mention that this<br>law<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> applies where she observed the flow at perfectly regular ones. But should not the law be<br>reversed, seeing that where she observes a flow at perfectly regular intervals she thereby establishes<br>for herself a fixed period and it should, therefore, suffice for her to reckon her period of uncleanness<br>from the time she observed the flow? And should you reply that this<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> represents the view of the<br>Rabbis who differ from R. Dosa in maintaining that even a woman who has a fixed period causes<br>retrospective uncleanness for twenty-four hours,<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> [it could be objected:] Should not the order<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> have<br>been reversed to read as follows: Not only where she observed the flow at successively decreasing<br>intervals or increasing intervals<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> but even where she observed it at perfectly regular ones?<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> —<br>Read: Not only where she observed the flow at successively decreasing intervals or increasing<br>intervals<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> but even where she observed it at perfectly regular ones.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> And if you prefer I might<br>reply, It is this that was meant: This<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> does not apply where a woman observed the flow at perfectly<br>regular intervals but only where she observed it at successively decreasing or increasing ones.<br>Where, however, she observed it at perfectly regular intervals she thereby establishes for herself a<br>fixed period and it suffices for her to reckon her uncleanness from the time she has observed the<br>flow. And whose view does this represent? That of R. Dosa.<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup><br>R. ELIEZER RULED: FOR ANY WOMAN OVER WHOM HAVE PASSED etc. It was taught:<br>R. Eliezer said to the Sages. It once happened to a young woman at Haitalu<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> that her menstrual flow<br>was interrupted for three ‘onahs, and when the matter was submitted to the Sages they ruled that it<br>sufficed for her to reckon her uncleanness from the time she observed the flow. They replied: A time<br>of emergency is no proof. What was the emergency? — Some say, It was a time of dearth,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> while<br>others say, The quantity of foodstuffs the woman had prepared<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> was rather large and the Rabbis<br>took into consideration the desirability of avoiding the loss of the levitically clean things.<br>Our Rabbis taught: It once happened that Rabbi acted in agreement with the ruling of R. Eliezer,<br>and after he reminded himself observed, ‘R. Eliezer deserves to be relied upon in an emergency’.<br>What could be the meaning of ‘after he reminded himself’? If it be explained: After he reminded<br>himself that the halachah was not in agreement with R. Eliezer but in agreement with the Rabbis [the<br>difficulty would arise:] How could he act according to the former's ruling even in an emergency? —<br>The fact is that it was not stated whether the law was in agreement with the one Master or with the<br>other Master. Then what is meant by ‘after he reminded himself’? — After he reminded himself that<br>it was not an individual that differed from him but that many differed from him, he observed ‘R.<br>Eliezer deserves to be relied upon in an emergency’.<br>Our Rabbis taught: If a young girl who had not yet attained the age of menstruation<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> observed a<br>discharge, after the first time it suffices for her to reckon her uncleanness from the time she observed<br>it; after the second time also<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> it suffices for her to reckon her uncleanness from the time she<br>observed it, but after the third time<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> she is in the same position as all other women<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> and<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> causes<br>uncleanness retrospectively<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> for twenty-four hours or from her previous examination to her last<br>examination. If subsequently three ‘onahs have passed over her<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> and then she again observed a<br>discharge it suffices for her<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> to reckon her uncleanness from the time she observed it.<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> If another<br>three ‘onahs have passed over her<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> and then again she observed a discharge it suffices for her to<br>reckon her uncleanness from the time she observed it.

        "R. Elai demurred:<sup>1</sup> But what is the difference between this class of woman and a virgin [just<br>married] whose blood is clean?<sup>2</sup> — R. Zera replied: In the case of the latter her secretion<sup>3</sup> is<br>frequent<sup>4</sup> but in that of the former her secretion is not frequent.<sup>5</sup><br>‘Ulla stated: R.

When they have reached the age of puberty they are definitely<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> in a condition of presumptive<br>uncleanness and [elder] women must examine them. R.

JOSE RULED: FOR A WOMAN IN PREGNANCY etc. A Tanna recited in the presence of R.<br>Eleazar, ‘R. Jose ruled: As for a woman in pregnancy and a nursing woman over whom three onahs<br>have passed it suffices for her<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> [to reckon her<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> period of uncleanness from] the time of her<br>[observation of the flow]’. ‘You’, the other remarked, ‘began with two<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> and finished with one;<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> do<br>you perchance mean: A pregnant woman who was also<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> a nurse,<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> and this<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> teaches us incidentally<br>the law that [in respect of an interval of three ‘onahs]<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> the days of a woman's pregnancy supplement<br>those of her nursing and those of her nursing supplement those of her pregnancy? As it was taught:<br>‘The days of her pregnancy supplement those of her nursing and the days of her nursing supplement<br>those of her pregnancy. In what manner? If there was a break<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> of two ‘onahs during her pregnancy<br>and of one during her nursing, or of two during her nursing and one during her pregnancy, or of one<br>and a half during her pregnancy and one and a half during her nursing, they are all combined into a<br>series of three ‘onahs’.<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> One can well understand the ruling that ‘the days of her pregnancy<br>supplement those of her nursing’ since this is possible where a woman became pregnant while she<br>was still continuing her nursing. But how is it possible that ‘the days of her nursing<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> supplement<br>those of her pregnancy’?<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> — If you wish I might reply: This is possible in the case of a dry birth.<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup><br>And if you prefer I might reply: Menstrual blood is one thing and birth blood is another thing.<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> And<br>if you prefer I might reply: Read the first clause only.<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup><br>OF WHAT DID THEY SPEAK WHEN THEY LAID DOWN THAT IT SUFFICES [FOR THEM<br>TO RECKON] THEIR [PERIOD OF UNCLEANNESS FROM] THE TIME [OF THEIR<br>DISCOVERY OF THE FLOW]’? etc. Rab stated: This<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> refers to all of them,<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> and Samuel stated:<br>This<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> was learnt only in respect of a virgin<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> and an old woman<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> but for pregnant or nursing<br>women<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> it suffices for them, throughout all the days of their pregnancy and throughout all the days<br>of their nursing respectively to reckon their uncleanness from the time of their observing a flow. In<br>the same manner R. Simeon b. Lakish stated: This<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> refers to all of them; while R. Johanan stated:<br>This was learnt only in respect of a virgin and an old woman but for pregnant or nursing women it<br>suffices throughout all the days of their pregnancy and throughout all the days of their nursing<br>respectively to reckon their uncleanness from the time of their observing the flow.

If on the following day, however, the colour of the discharge changed the woman becomes<br>unclean, but a bloodstain discovered after intercourse (cf. infra <sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup>a) is nevertheless clean.

        "bleeding profusely it suffices for them, throughout all the days of their pregnancy and throughout all<br>the days of their nursing respectively, to reckon their uncleanness from the time of their observing<br>their flow; so R. Meir. R. Jose and R. Judah and R. Simeon, however, ruled: Only after a first<br>observation did [the Sages] rule that it suffices for them<sup>1</sup> to reckon their uncleanness from the time<br>of their observing the flow but after a second observation they cause uncleanness retrospectively for<br>twenty-four hours or from their previous examination to their last examination.<br>IF, HOWEVER, SHE SUFFERED THE FIRST FLOW etc. R. Huna ruled: If on three occasions<br>she jumped and suffered a flow she<sup>2</sup> has thereby established for herself a fixed period.<sup>3</sup> In what<br>respect?<sup>4</sup> If it be suggested, In respect of certain days,<sup>5</sup> could it not be objected that on any day on<br>which she did not jump she observed no flow?<sup>6</sup> — Rather, [the fixation meant is in respect] of<br>jumps.<sup>7</sup> But surely it was taught: ‘Any regular discharge established as a result of an accident, even<br>though it had been repeated many times, does not establish a fixed period’. Does not this mean that<br>no fixed period whatsoever<sup>8</sup> is established? — No, it means that no fixed period is established in<br>respect of days alone<sup>9</sup> or jumps alone,<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> but as regards days and jumps jointly<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> a fixed period is well<br>established.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> But ‘is it not obvious<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> [that no fixed period can be established] in respect of days<br>alone?<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> — R. Ashi replied: [This<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> was necessary in a case] for instance, where the woman jumped<br>on two Sundays and suffered a flow while on a Sabbath<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> she jumped and suffered no flow but on<br>the Sunday following she observed one without jumping. As it might have been presumed that it had<br>now become known retrospectively that<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> it was the day<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> and not the jumping<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> that had caused the<br>flow,<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> we were informed<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> that it was the jump of the previous day<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> ‘that was the cause<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> and that<br>the reason why the woman did not observe it was because the jump was premature.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup><br>Another reading:<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> R.

In what<br>circumstances?<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> — R. Ashi replied: If a woman jumped on two Sundays and on each occasion<br>suffered a flow while<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> on one<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> Sunday she suffered one without jumping where it is obvious that it<br>is the day<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> that is the cause.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup><br><b>MISHNAH</b>. ALTHOUGH [THE SAGES] HAVE LAID DOWN THAT [FOR A WOMAN WHO<br>HAS A SETTLED PERIOD] IT SUFFICES TO RECKON HER PERIOD OF UNCLEANNESS<br>FROM THE TIME SHE OBSERVED THE FLOW, SHE MUST NEVERTHELESS EXAMINE<br>HERSELF [REGULARLY],<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> EXCEPT WHERE SHE IS A MENSTRUANT<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> OR<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> IS<br>CONTINUING IN THE BLOOD OF PURIFICATION.<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> SHE<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> MUST ALSO USE<br>TESTING-RAGS WHEN<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> SHE HAS MARITAL INTERCOURSE EXCEPT WHEN SHE<br>CONTINUES IN THE BLOOD OF PURIFICATION<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> OR WHEN SHE IS A VIRGIN<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> WHOSE<br>BLOOD IS CLEAN.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> AND TWICE [DAILY] MUST SHE<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> EXAMINE HERSELF: IN THE<br>MORNING<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> AND AT THE [EVENING] TWILIGHT,<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> AND ALSO WHEN SHE IS ABOUT<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup><br>TO PERFORM HER MARITAL DUTY.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> PRIESTLY WOMEN ARE SUBJECT TO AN<br>ADDITIONAL RESTRICTION [IN HAVING TO MAKE EXAMINATION] WHEN THEY ARE<br>ABOUT TO EAT TERUMAH.

EXCEPT WHEN SHE IS A MENSTRUANT, because during the days of her<br>menstruation she needs no examination.<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> This<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> is quite satisfactory according to R. Simeon b.<br>Lakish who ruled, ‘A woman may establish for herself a settled period during the days of her zibah<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup><br>but not during the days of her menstruation’,<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> [since the discarding of an examination would be]<br>well justified.<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> According to R. Johanan, however, who ruled, ‘A woman may establish for herself a<br>settled period during the days of her menstruation’, why should she not examine herself seeing that it<br>is possible that she had established for herself a settled period?<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> — R. Johanan can answer you: I<br>only spoke of a case where the woman observed the flow issuing<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> from a previously closed<br>source,<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> but I did not speak of one where she observed it issuing<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> from an already open source.<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup><br>OR IS CONTINUING IN THE BLOOD OF PURIFICATION. It was assumed that the reference<br>is to one who is only desirous of continuing in the blood of purification.<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> Now this<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> is quite<br>satisfactory according to Rab who holds that ‘it<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> all emanates from the same source which the<br>Torah declared to be unclean [during a certain period]<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> and clean [during another period]’<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> [since<br>the discarding of an examination would be] well justified;<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> but according to Levi who holds that<br>‘it<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> emanates from two different sources’<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> why should she not examine herself, seeing that it is<br>possible<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> that the unclean source had not yet ceased to flow?<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> — Levi can answer you: This<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> is in<br>agreement with<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup><br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Pregnant and nursing women.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Though a flow resulting from a jump is obviously an accident.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) This is explained presently.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Is the period fixed.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) I.e., if the jump and resulting flow took place, for instance, on three Sundays, every subsequent Sunday is regarded as<br>the fixed day so that even in the absence of a jump, if on examination she discovered a flow, her uncleanness is not<br>retrospective, while if she failed to examine herself she is deemed to be unclean on the presumption that the flow had<br>appeared at the fixed time.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Which proves that the day itself is not the fixed period. How then could a Sunday on which she does not jump (cf.<br>prev. n.) be regarded as the fixed period?<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Sc. on any day she jumped she is presumed to be unclean unless on examination she found herself to be clean.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Even in respect of jumps.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) The Sundays, for instance, (cf. supra, p. <sup>6</sup><sup>9</sup>, n. <sup>7</sup>) on which she did not jump.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) On any day other than a Sunday.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) I.e., a Sunday on which she jumped.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) If she jumped on any Sunday that day is deemed to be her fixed period.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) Since each discharge was preceded by a jump.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) The answer being in the affirmative the difficulty arises: What need was there to teach the obvious?<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) The ruling that no fixed period is established in respect of days alone.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Saturday.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) As on the Saturday on which she jumped she suffered no flow while on the Sunday following on which she did not<br>jump she observed one.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) The Sunday, since it was the third on which she observed a flow.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Cf. prev. n. but one.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) And Sunday might consequently be regarded as her fixed period irrespective of whether she jumped on it or not.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) By the ruling under discussion (cf. supra n. <sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Of the discharge on the Sunday.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘the time of jumping had not yet arrived’. Her fixed period, therefore, is only a Sunday (not any other day of<br>the week) on which she jumped (and no Sunday on which she did not jump).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Cf. nn. on first reading supra, mut. mut.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) Lit., ‘how is this to be imagined?’<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Cur. edd. in parenthesis, ‘and on the Sabbath (Saturday) she jumped and did not observe (a flow)’.

Hence the ruling that a fixed period has been established ‘in respect of days’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) Morning and evening; in order to make sure that there was no discharge whatsoever.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Who, having suffered a flow, is unclean for seven days irrespective of whether she had a flow or not on any of the<br>last six days.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) After a childbirth.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) Cf.

Such an examination could serve no useful purpose whatsoever. It cannot serve the purpose<br>of ascertaining whether she is clean (since she is in any case unclean even in the absence of a discharge) and it cannot<br>serve the purpose of enabling her to establish a settled period (since no settled period can be established during the seven<br>days of menstruation).<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup>) Cf. prev. n. but one mut. mut.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup>) On each of the three occasions.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>) If, e.g., the flow made its first appearance (cf. infra <sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>b) on the first day of three consecutive months as well on the<br>twenty-fifth of the second month. In this case the first day of each subsequent month is regarded as the settled period,<br>because the first two of the three discharges originated from a closed source (there having been no flow before) while the<br>last (though it appeared after the menstruation had begun on the twenty-fifth of the previous months) is also regarded as<br>originating from a closed source since the discharge on the twenty-fifth which originated from a closed source is deemed<br>to be the commencement of the flow on the first of the following month that followed it.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup>) Even on one of the three occasions.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup>) As is the case spoken of in our Mishnah where even the first observation would be made during menstruation where<br>the source is already open.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup>) But had not yet commenced then, i.e., a woman after childbirth who concluded the seven unclean days for a male or<br>the fourteen unclean days for a female (cf.

        "Beth Shammai who hold that ‘it<sup>1</sup> all emanates from the same source’.<sup>2</sup> But would the Tanna teach an<br>anonymous Mishnah<sup>3</sup> in agreement with the view of Beth Shammai?<sup>4</sup> — This is an anonymous<br>ruling that is followed by a divergence of opinion, and wherever an anonymous ruling is followed by<br>a dispute the halachah does not agree with the anonymous ruling. And if you prefer I might reply:<br>Was it stated,<sup>5</sup> ‘desirous of CONTINUING’?<sup>6</sup> It was only stated, ‘CONTINUING’.<sup>7</sup> But if the<br>woman was already ‘continuing’<sup>7</sup> what was the purpose of stating the ruling?<sup>8</sup> — It might have been<br>assumed that she should examine herself in case she establishes for herself<sup>9</sup> a settled period, hence<br>we were informed [that no examination is necessary] because no settled period can be established<br>[by the regularity of a discharge from] a clean source for that of an unclean one. This is satisfactory<br>according to Levi who stated that there are two sources,<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> but according to Rab who stated that there<br>was only one source<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> why should she not examine herself seeing that she might have established for<br>herself<sup>9</sup> a settled period? — Even in that case she cannot establish a settled period in the clean days<br>for the unclean ones.<br>SHE MUST ALSO USE TESTING-RAGS WHEN SHE HAS MARITAL INTERCOURSE etc.<br>We have learnt elsewhere: If a young girl, whose age of menstruation<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> had not yet arrived, married,<br>Beth Shammai ruled: She is allowed<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> four nights,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> and Beth Hillel ruled: Until the wound is<br>healed.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> R. Giddal citing Samuel stated: They<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> learnt this<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> only in the case where bleeding<br>through intercourse had not ceased, though she subsequently observed a discharge that may not have<br>been due to intercourse;<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> but if bleeding through intercourse had ceased<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> and then she observed a<br>discharge<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> she<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> is unclean.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> If one night has passed without intercourse and then she observed a<br>discharge she is unclean. If the colour of her blood changed<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> she is unclean.<br>R. Jonah raised an objection:<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> OR WHEN SHE IS A VIRGIN WHOSE BLOOD IS CLEAN [she<br>need not use testing-rags]. But why should she not rather use testing-rags<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> seeing that it is possible<br>that the colour of her blood had changed? — Raba replied, Read the first clause: EXCEPT WHERE<br>SHE IS A MENSTRUANT OR IS CONTINUING IN THE BLOOD OF PURIFICATION, from<br>which it follows that only in those cases no examination is required but that a virgin whose blood is<br>clean does require one.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> But, then, are not the two rulings<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> mutually contradictory? — The<br>former<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> refers to one who had marital intercourse, where it might well be assumed that the<br>membrum was the cause of the change;<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> while the latter<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> refers to one who had no marital<br>intercourse.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> So it was also taught: This<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> applies only in the case where ‘bleeding through<br>intercourse had not ceased, though she subsequently observed a discharge that may not have been<br>due to intercourse, but if bleeding through intercourse had ceased and then she observed a discharge<br>she is unclean. If one night has passed without intercourse and then she observed a discharge she is<br>unclean.

But what new point does he<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> teach us, seeing that we have learnt: All<br>women are in a condition of presumptive cleanness for their husbands?<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> — If the ruling were to be<br>derived from the Mishnah<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> it might have been presumed that the ruling applied only to a woman<br>who had a settled period but that a woman who had no settled period does require examination.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup><br>But does not our Mishnah<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> deal with one who has a settled period?<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> — Our Mishnah deals with<br>both one who had a settled period, and one who had no settled period,<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> and it is this that was<br>meant,<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> that although she had a settled period, since she must be examined for the sake of the clean<br>things she handled she must also be examined for the sake of her husband. But did not Samuel state<br>this<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> once, for R. Zera citing R. Abba b. Jeremiah who had it from Samuel stated, ‘A woman who<br>had no settled period may not perform marital intercourse before she has examined herself’<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> and it<br>has been explained<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> to refer to one who was engaged in the handling of clean things?<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> — The one<br>statement<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> was inferred from the other.<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> So it was also taught: This<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> applies only to clean things<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup><br>but to her husband she is permitted.<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> This,<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> however, applies only where he left her in a state of<br>presumptive cleanness, but if he left her in one of presumptive uncleanness she remains for ever in<br>her uncleanness until she tells him, ‘I am clean’.<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) The blood discharged within the forty or eighty days respectively after childbirth (cf.

Huna: Must<sup>5</sup> a woman examine herself immediately [after intercourse] in<br>order to make her husband liable to a sin-offering?<sup>6</sup> The other replied: Is it at all possible for an<br>examination to take place immediately [after intercourse], seeing that it was taught: ‘What is meant<br>by \"immediately\"? This may be illustrated by the parable of an attendant<sup>7</sup> and the witness<sup>8</sup> who<br>stand at the side of the lintel<sup>9</sup> where the witness enters immediately after the attendant goes out, this<br>being the interval which the Rabbis allowed as regards wiping off<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> but not as regards<br>examination’?<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> — The question rather is whether she must wipe herself.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> Some there are who say<br>that it was this that he<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> enquired of him:<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> Must a woman examine herself [after intercourse]<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> in<br>order to make her husband liable<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> to a suspended guilt-offering?<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> — The other replied: She should<br>not examine herself. But [why should she not] examine herself, seeing that none could be the worse<br>for it?<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> — If [she were to do] so<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> her husband would be uncertain in his mind<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> and he would keep<br>away from her.<br>AND ALSO WHEN SHE IS ABOUT etc. R. Ammi citing R. Jannai remarked: And this is the<br>test<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> of virtuous women.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> Said R. Abba b. Memel to R. Ammi: The Tanna learnt MUST,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> [how<br>then could] you learn ‘virtuous women’?<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> — The other replied: Because I maintain that whosoever<br>observes the enactments of the Sages may be described as<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> virtuous.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> Said Raba: Would then<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> one<br>who does not observe the enactments of the Sages merely lose the designation of<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> virtuous man but<br>would not be called wicked? Rather, said Raba, as for virtuous women the testing-rag, with which<br>they have examined themselves before one intercourse, they do not use it before any other<br>intercourse, but those who are not virtuous use it and do not mind.<br>[Reverting to] the main text,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> ‘R. Zera citing R. Abba b. Jeremiah who had it from Samuel stated:<br>A woman who has no settled period may not perform marital intercourse before she has examined<br>herself’. Said R. Zera to R. Abba b. Jeremiah: Is it<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> only one who has no settled period that must<br>have an examination while a woman who has a settled period requires no examination?<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> — The<br>other replied: A woman who has a settled period must have an examination<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> only when she is<br>awake<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> but not when she is asleep;<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> while a woman who has no settled period must have an<br>examination whether she is awake or asleep. Raba observed: Could he<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> not reply<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> that a woman<br>who had a settled period must be examined<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> in respect of clean things<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> but not in respect of her<br>husband [alone]<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> while a woman who had no settled period must have an examination even in<br>respect of her husband [alone]?<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> As, however, he did not give such a reply it may be inferred that<br>Samuel holds the view that in respect of her husband alone<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> a woman<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> needs no examination.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: The wives of ass-drivers,<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> labourers<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> and people coming from a house of<br>mourning<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> or a house of feasting<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> are in respect of their husbands<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> deemed to be in a state of<br>presumptive cleanness and the latter may, therefore, come and stay with them whether they are<br>asleep or awake. This, however, applies only where the men<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> left the woman in a state of<br>presumptive cleanness but if they left them in a state of presumptive uncleanness each woman is<br>forever regarded as unclean until she announces to her husband ‘I am clean’. But how does Samuel<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup><br>explain this case?<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> If it refers to a woman who has a settled period, does not a difficulty arise from<br>the case where she is awake?<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> And if it refers to one who has no settled period, does not a difficulty<br>arise both from the case where she is awake and from that where she is asleep?<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> — As a matter of<br>fact it refers to one who had a settled period<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> but<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> as the husband had solicited her<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> there can be<br>no more reliable<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> examination than this.<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup><br>R. Papa asked Raba: May one<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> act in accordance with that Baraitha?<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup><br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Lit., what is it (the ruling)’.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Before intercourse.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘and what is there in it’.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Lit., ‘his heart beats him’.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Lit., ‘what is it (the ruling)’.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Should any trace of blood be found.

According to this Baraitha no examination is required while according to Samuel (cf. (a) note <sup>6</sup>)<br>an examination is required.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>) In both cases (even when the woman is awake), no examination is expected, while according to Samuel (cf.

        "— The other replied: Brewer,<sup>1</sup> no; because [otherwise]<sup>2</sup> she would become repulsive to him.<br>R. Kahana stated, ‘I asked the women folk of the house of R. Papa and of R. Huna son of R.<br>Joshua, \"Do the Rabbis on coming home from the schoolhouse require you to undergo an<br>examination\"? And they answered me in the negative’. But why did he<sup>3</sup> not ask<sup>4</sup> the Rabbis<br>themselves? — Because it is possible that they imposed additional restrictions upon themselves.<sup>5</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: A woman who has no settled period is forbidden marital intercourse and is<br>entitled neither to a kethubah<sup>6</sup> nor to a usufruct<sup>7</sup> nor to maintenance,<sup>8</sup> nor to her worn-out clothes.<sup>9</sup><br>Her husband, furthermore, must divorce her and may never marry her again; so R. Meir. R. Hanina<br>b. Antigonus ruled: She must use two testing-rags when she has marital intercourse; they render her<br>unfit<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> and they also render her fit.<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> In the name of Abba Hanan it was stated: Woe to her<br>husband.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> ‘She is forbidden marital intercourse’, because she might<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> cause him moral injury. ‘And<br>is entitled neither to a kethubah’, since she is unfit for cohabitation she is not entitled to a kethubah.<br>‘Nor to usufruct nor to maintenance nor to her worn-out clothes’ because the provisions<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> embodied<br>in the agreed terms of a kethubah are subject to the same laws as the kethubah itself.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> ‘Her husband,<br>furthermore, must divorce her and may never marry her again’. Is not this obvious?<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> — It was<br>necessary in the case where she was subsequently cured.<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> As it might have been presumed that [in<br>such a case] he may remarry her we were informed [that this is forbidden], because it may<br>sometimes happen that having proceeded to marry another man she would be cured and [her first<br>husband] would then say, ‘Had I known that to be the case I would not have divorced her even if you<br>had given me a hundred maneh’, and the get would thus be annulled and her children would be<br>bastards.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup><br>‘In the name of Abba Hanan it was stated: Woe to her husband’. Some explain: He said this in<br>opposition to R. Meir,<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> because [Abba Hanan maintains that] she must be allowed to collect her<br>kethubah. Others there are who explain: He said it in opposition to R. Hanina b. Antigonus,<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup><br>because [Abba Hanan maintains that intercourse is always forbidden] since thereby she might<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup><br>cause her husband to sin.<br>Rab Judah citing Samuel stated: The halachah is in agreement with R. Hanina b. Antigonus. But in<br>what case? If it is one where the woman is engaged in the handling of clean things, has not Samuel<br>[it may be objected] said it once?<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> And if it is one where she was not engaged in the handling of<br>clean things, did he not say [it may again be objected] that as far as her husband is concerned she<br>requires no examination, for did not R. Zera in fact state in the name of R. Abba b. Jeremiah who<br>had it from Samuel, ‘A woman who had no settled period may not perform marital intercourse before<br>she examines herself’, and it has been explained to refer to one who was engaged in the handling of<br>clean things?<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> — He who taught the one did not teach the other.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> [<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Sodani, reference to R.

Tosaf.) if it had been necessary for the husband to rouse her and to wait until she has collected her thoughts<br>and was in a condition to reply (contra Rashi).<br>(<sup>3</sup>) R. Kahana.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) What the law was.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) And this could be ascertained only by enquiring from the women. Had the enquiry been addressed to the Rabbis<br>themselves they might have given the lenient ruling which applied to all, while R.

Her husband is entitled to the usufruct despite<br>the fact that she is deprived of her kethubah.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Sc. if her husband before divorcing her went abroad the court does not authorize her to collect her maintenance<br>expenses from his estate.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Though a woman as a rule is entitled to take with her when divorced whatever is left of the clothes she brought to her<br>husband on marriage as melog property (cf. Keth. <sup>7</sup><sup>9</sup>b).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) If any blood is observed on them.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) If they remained clean.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) This is explained infra.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) Should a discharge occur during intercourse.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Such as are the benefits mentioned.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) As she cannot claim her kethubah she cannot claim these benefits either.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Why then should an obvious ruling have to be enunciated?<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) I.e., acquired a settled period.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Hence the ruling that he may never again marry her, even if she subsequently acquired a settled period. On the basis<br>of this ruling the husband is duly cautioned when divorce is arranged that his act is definite and final and, consequently,<br>any subsequent plea of his ‘Had I known etc.’ has no validity whatsoever (cf. Git. <sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>a).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Who ruled that she is not entitled to her kethubah from her husband.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Who holds that if she uses testing-rags she may have intercourse.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Were a discharge to occur during intercourse.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Cf. supra <sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>b ad fin. and infra.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) Supra l.c.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) It refers indeed to the case where the woman was engaged in handling clean things: but Samuel having given his<br>ruling only once, Rab Judah applied it to the ruling of R. Hanina b. Antigonus, while R. Abba quoted it as an<br>independent ruling.",
        "C H A P T E R I I<br><b>MISHNAH</b>. EVERY HAND THAT MAKES FREQUENT EXAMINATION IS IN THE CASE<br>OF WOMEN PRAISEWORTHY,<sup>1</sup> BUT IN THE CASE OF MEN IT OUGHT TO BE CUT OFF.<sup>2</sup><br><b>GEMARA</b>. Wherein [in this respect]<sup>3</sup> do women differ from men?<sup>4</sup> — Women [in this matter] are<br>not sensitive,<sup>5</sup> hence they are praiseworthy,<sup>1</sup> but in the case of men who are highly sensitive [their<br>hands] ought to be cut off.<sup>2</sup> But, if so,<sup>2</sup> what was the point in saying ‘MAKES FREQUENT’ [seeing<br>that the same reason<sup>2</sup> applies] also where [the examinations are] infrequent? — When ‘MAKES<br>FREQUENT’ was mentioned it was intended to refer to women only.<sup>6</sup><br>One taught: This<sup>7</sup> applies only to the emission of semen but as regards flux<sup>8</sup> a man also is as<br>praiseworthy as the women;<sup>9</sup> and even in regard to the emission of semen, if he desires to make the<br>examination with a splinter or with a potsherd<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> he may do so. May he not, however, do it with a rag,<br>seeing that it was taught: A man may examine himself with a rag or with any other thing he wishes?<br>— As Abaye stated elsewhere: ‘With a thick rag’.<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> so also here<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> it may be explained: With a thick<br>rag.<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> And in what connection was Abaye's statement made? In connection with the following: If a<br>priest, while eating terumah, felt a shiver run through his body<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> he takes hold of his membrum<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> and<br>swallows the terumah.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> ‘Takes hold’! But has it not been taught: R. Eliezer said, ‘Whoever holds<br>his membrum when he makes water is as though he had brought a flood on the world’?<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> To this<br>Abaye replied. ‘With a thick rag’.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> Raba replied: It<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> may even be said to apply to a soft rag for<br>once the semen has been detached the subsequent touch does no longer matter.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> And Abaye?<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> —<br>He made provision against the possibility of an additional discharge.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> And Raba? — He does not<br>consider the possibility of any additional discharges. But does he not, seeing that it was taught, ‘To<br>what may this<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> be compared? To the putting of a finger upon the eye where, as long as the finger<br>remains on it, the eye continues to tear’?<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> Now Raba?<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> — It is quite uncommon for one to get<br>heated twice in immediate succession.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup><br>[Reverting to] the main text: ‘R. Eliezer said, Whoever holds his membrum when he makes water<br>is as though he had brought a flood on the world’. But, they said to R. Eliezer, would not the spray<br>bespatter his feet and he would appear to be maimed in his privy parts so that he<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> would be the<br>cause of casting upon his children the reflection of being illegitimate? — It is preferable, he<br>answered them, that a man should be the cause of casting upon his children the reflection of being<br>illegitimate than that he should make himself a wicked man, even for a while, before the<br>Omnipresent. Another [Baraitha] taught: R. Eliezer replied to the Sages. It is possible for a man to<br>stand on a raised spot and to make water or to make water in loose earth and thus to avoid making<br>himself wicked, even for a while, before the Omnipresent. Which<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> did he<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> tell them<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> first? If it be<br>suggested that it was the first mentioned statement that he gave them first [is it likely, it may be<br>objected], that after he spoke to them of a prohibition<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> he would merely offer a remedy?<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> — The<br>fact is that it was the last mentioned statement<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> that he gave them first, and when they asked him,<br>‘What is he to do when he can find no raised spot or loose earth’, he answered them, ‘It is preferable<br>that a man should be the cause of casting upon his children the reflection of being illegitimate than<br>that he should make himself a wicked man, even for a while, before the Omnipresent’.<br>But why all these precautions?<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> — Because otherwise one might emit semen in vain, and R.<br>Johanan stated: Whosoever emits semen in vain deserves death, for it is said in Scripture. And the<br>thing<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> which he did<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> was evil in the sight of the Lord, and He slew him also.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> R. Isaac and R.<br>Ammi said. He<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> is as though he shed blood, for it is said in Scripture. Ye that inflame yourselves<br>among the terebinths, under every leafy tree, that slay the children in the valleys under the clefts of<br>the rocks;<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> read not ‘that slay’<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> but ‘that press out’.<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> R. Assi said: He<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> is like one who worships<br>idols; for here<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> it is written, ‘Under every leafy tree’ and elsewhere<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> it is written, upon the high<br>mountains . . . and under every leafy tree.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup><br>Rab Judah and Samuel once stood upon the roof of the Synagogue of Shaf-weyathib<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> in<br>Nehardea. Said Rab Judah to Samuel ‘I must make water’. ‘Shinena’,<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> the other replied, ‘take hold<br>of your membrum<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> and make the water outside [the roof]’. But how could he<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> do so, seeing that it<br>was taught: R. Eliezer said, Whoever holds his membrum when he makes water is as though he<br>brought a flood on the world? — Abaye replied: He treated this case as that of a reconnoitering<br>troop, concerning which we learnt, ‘If a reconnoitering troop has entered a town in time of peace the<br>open wine jars are forbidden<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> and the closed ones are permitted,<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> but in times of war the former as<br>well as the latter are permitted because the troops have no time to offer libations’.<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> Thus it clearly<br>follows that owing to their being in a state of fear they do not think<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> of offering libations, and so<br>also in this case, since he<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> was in a state of fear he would not think of lustful matters. But what fear<br>could there be here? — If you wish I might reply: The fear of the night and of the roof.<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> If you<br>prefer I might reply: The fear of his Master.<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> If you prefer I might say: The fear of the Shechinah.<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup><br>If you prefer I might say: The fear of the Lord that was<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> upon him,<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> for Samuel once remarked of<br>him<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> ‘This man is no mortal being’.<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> If you prefer I might say: He was a married man, and<br>concerning such R. Nahman ruled, ‘If a man was married, this is permitted’. If you prefer I might<br>say: It was this that he taught him, vis., that which R. Abba the son of R. Benjamin b. Hiyya learnt:<br>But he may support the testicles from below. And if you prefer I might say: It was this that he taught<br>them, viz., that which R. Abbahu stated in the name of R. Johanan: It has a limit; from the corona<br>downward [touch] is permitted<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Since both husband and wife are thereby saved either from doubtful uncleanness or from certain transgression.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Because of masturbation.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) FREQUENT EXAMINATION.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Sc. why is the hand of the former PRAISEWORTHY while that of the latter OUGHT TO BE CUT OFF?<br>(<sup>5</sup>) I.e., the examination does not unduly excite their passions.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Cf. n. <sup>1</sup>.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) The culpability of men who make such examinations.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) I.e., when a man is suffering from gonorrhoea and is desirous of ascertaining the number of attacks he had (v. next<br>n.).<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Since it is necessary to ascertain whether the attack occurred only twice or three times. In the former case the man is<br>only unclean while in the latter he must also bring a sacrifice.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Avoiding masturbation.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) In the Baraitha just cited.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Lit., ‘that his limbs trembled’, an indication of the imminent emission of semen.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) To restrain the emission.

The generation of the flood were guilty of such offences (cf. R.H. <sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>a). Now how, in view of<br>R. Eliezer's statement, could one be allowed to commit an offence even for the sake of terumah?<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Avoiding masturbation.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) In the Baraitha just cited.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Lit., ‘since it was uprooted it was uprooted’, no more semen would be emitted despite the heat engendered.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Why, in view of Raba's explanation, does he restrict the application to a thick rag only?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Of semen.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) The touching of the membrum after an emission.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Infra <sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>a.

        "but from the corona upwards<sup>1</sup> it is forbidden.<br>Rab stated: ‘A man who wilfully causes erection should be placed<sup>2</sup> under the ban’. But why did<br>he<sup>3</sup> not say, ‘This is forbidden’? Because the man<sup>4</sup> merely incites his evil inclination against<br>himself.<sup>5</sup> R.

Ishmael, Thou shalt not commit adultery<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> implies, Thou shalt not<br>practise masturbation either with hand or with foot.<br>Our Rabbis taught: ‘proselytes and those that play with children delay the advent of the Messiah’.<br>The statement about proselytes may be understood on the lines of the view of R. Helbo, for R. Helbo<br>said, ‘proselytes are as hard for Israel to endure as a sore’,<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> what, however, could be meant by<br>‘those that play with children’?<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> If it be suggested: Those that practise pederasty [it could well be<br>objected]: Are not such people subject to stoning?<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> If, however, it be suggested: Those that practise<br>onanism through external contact<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> [it could be objected]: Are not such deserving destruction by<br>flood?<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> — The meaning rather is: Those that marry minors who are not capable of bearing children,<br>for R. Jose<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> stated: The Son of David<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> will not come before all the souls in Guf<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> will have been<br>disposed of, since it is said, For the spirit that enwrappeth itself is from Me, and the souls which I<br>have made.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> BUT IN THE CASE OF MEN IT OUGHT TO BE CUT OFF. The question was<br>raised: Have we here<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> learnt a law or merely an execration? ‘Have we here learnt a law’ as in the<br>case where R. Huna cut off one's hand;<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> ‘or merely an execration’? — Come and hear what was<br>taught: R. Tarfon said, ‘If his hand touched the membrum let his hand be cut off upon his belly’.<br>‘But’, they said to him,<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> ‘would not his belly be split’? ‘It is preferable’, he replied, ‘that his belly<br>shall be split rather than that he should go down into the pit of destruction’.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> Now if you concede<br>that we have here<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> learnt a law<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> one can well understand why they said, ‘Would not his belly be<br>split’; but if you maintain that we have only learnt of an execration,<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> what could be meant by [the<br>question] ‘His belly be split’? — What then would you suggest, that we have learnt here a law,<br>would it not suffice, [it may be objected, that the cutting off shall] not be done on his belly? — The<br>fact, however, is that it was this that R. Tarfon meant: Whosoever puts his hand below his belly that<br>hand shall be cut off. They said to R. Tarfon, ‘If a thorn stuck in his belly, should he not remove it’?<br>‘No’, he replied. ‘But [they said] would not his belly be split’?<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> ‘It is preferable’, he replied, ‘that<br>his belly shall be split rather than that he should go down to the pit of destruction’.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> MISHNAH.

Why should not a DEAF woman make her own examination, seeing that it was taught:<br>Rabbi stated, A deaf woman was living in our neighbourhood and not only<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> did she examine herself<br>but her friends also on observing a discharge would show it to her?<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> — There it was a woman who<br>could speak but not hear while here the reference is to one who can neither speak nor hear; as we<br>have learnt: The deaf person of whom the Sages spoke is always<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> one who can neither hear nor<br>speak.<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup><br>A BLIND. Why should she not make her own examination and show the testing-rag to her friend?<br>— R. Jose son of R.

Is not this exactly the same as IMBECILE?<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> This refers to one<br>whose mind was deranged owing to a disease.<br>Our Rabbis taught: A priest who is an imbecile may be ritually immersed and then fed with<br>terumah<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> in the evening.<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> He must also be watched that he does not fall asleep.<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> If he falls asleep<br>he is deemed unclean<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> and if he does not fall asleep he remains clean. R. Eliezer son of R.

Eleazar, The imbecile is to be provided with a<br>metal bag. Abaye explained: It must be one of copper, as we have learnt:<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> R. Judah ruled, Those<br>buds of hyssop<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> are regarded<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> as if they had been made of copper.<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup><br>R. Papa remarked: From this<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> it may be inferred that breeches<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> are forbidden. But is it not<br>written in Scripture, And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover the flesh of their<br>nakedness?<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> — That may be explained as it was taught: To what were the breeches of the priests<br>like?

For we learnt:<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> If a woman when attending to her needs<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> observed a discharge of blood, R.<br>Meir ruled: If she was standing at the time she is unclean but if she was sitting she is clean. R. Jose<br>ruled: In either case she is regarded as clean.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> Said R. Aha son of Raba to R. Ashi: But did not R.<br>Jose the son of R. Hanina state that when R.

This<br>may be illustrated by the parable of the attendant and the witness who stood at the side of the lintel<br>where the witness enters immediately after the attendant goes out, this being the interval which the<br>Rabbis allowed as regards wiping off,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> but not as regards an examination.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup><br>IF, HOWEVER, ANY BLOOD IS FOUND ON HER RAG AFTER A TIME etc. A Tanna taught:<br>They<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> do incur the obligation of bringing a suspensive guilt-offering. But what is the reason of our<br>Tanna?<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> — It is essential<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> [that the doubt shall be of the same nature as in the case of the<br>consumption of] one piece of two pieces.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup><br>WHAT IS MEANT BY ‘AFTER A TIME’? etc. Is not, however, this<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> incongruous with the<br>following: What is meant by ‘after a time’? R. Eleazar<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> son of R. Zadok explained: Within an<br>interval in which<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> she can stretch out her hand, put it under the cushion or bolster, take out a<br>testing-rag and make examination with it?<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> — R. Hisda replied: By AFTER is meant the interval<br>following this interval.<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> But was it not stated in connection with this,<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> IF, HOWEVER, ANY<br>BLOOD IS FOUND ON HER RAG AFTER A TIME THEY ARE UNCLEAN, BY REASON OF<br>THE DOUBT BUT EXEMPT FROM THE SACRIFICE. WHAT IS MEANT BY ‘AFTER A<br>TIME’? WITHIN AN INTERVAL IN WHICH SHE CAN DESCEND FROM THE BED AND<br>WASH HER FACE?<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> — It is this that was implied:<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> WHAT IS MEANT BY ‘AFTER A TIME’?<br>Within an interval in which she can stretch out her hand, put it under the cushion or bolster, take out<br>a testing-rag and make examination with it; and WITHIN AN INTERVAL IN WHICH SHE CAN<br>DESCEND FROM THE BED AND WASH HER FACE [the question of uncleanness is subject to] a<br>divergence of view between R. Akiba and the Sages. But was it not stated,<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> AFTER SUCH AN<br>INTERVAL?<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> — It is this that was meant: And this is the interval concerning which R. Akiba and<br>the Sages are at variance.<br>R. Ashi replied: The former and the latter<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> represent the same length of time; when she has the<br>testing-rag in her hand the time IS WITHIN AN INTERVAL IN WHICH SHE CAN DESCEND<br>FROM THE BED AND WASH HER FACE, but if she has not the rag in her hand the time is limited<br>to ‘within an interval in which she can stretch out her hand, put it under the cushion or bolster, take<br>out a testing-rag and make examination with it’.<br>An objection was raised: What is meant by ‘after a time’? This question was submitted by R.<br>Eleazar son of R. Zadok to the Sages at Usha when he asked them,<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) The bloodmark on the rag.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Lit., ‘like a bean and more’.

In the former<br>case the uncleanness is certain and the sacrifice incurred is a sin-offering, while in the latter case the uncleanness is of a<br>doubtful nature and the sacrifice incurred is a suspensive guilt-offering.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) Husband and wife, contrary to the ruling of the Tanna of our Mishnah that they are EXEMPT FROM THE<br>SACRIFICE.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) Cf. prev. n.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) If a suspensive guilt-offering is to be incurred.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) One of which was e.g., permitted fat and the the other was forbidden fat, and it is not known which of the two<br>pieces the person in question had consumed. Only in such a case of doubt is a suspensive guilt-offering incurred (cf. Ker.<br><sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>b). Where, however, the doubt involves only one object or person (as is the case under discussion where only one<br>woman is concerned) no suspensive guilt-offering can be incurred.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) The definition of ‘AFTER A TIME’<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) So Bah.

How<br>then are the two rulings to be reconciled?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) Defined in our Baraitha. Lit., ‘after the after’. During the interval as defined in the Baraitha both husband and wife<br>are subject to doubtful uncleanness but after that interval, and during the one defined in our Mishnah, the woman,<br>according to the Rabbis, as stated in the next clause of the Mishnah, does not convey any uncleanness to her husband.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) The interval defined in our Mishnah.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) Which clearly shows, does it not, that during the interval spoken of in our Mishnah the woman does carry<br>uncleanness to her husband?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) Sc. some words are missing from our Mishnah and are to be regarded as inserted.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) In connection with the dispute between R.

        "‘Are you perchance of the same opinion as R. Akiba that the woman<sup>1</sup> carries uncleanness to the man<br>who had intercourse with her?’<sup>2</sup> ‘We’, they answered him, ‘have not heard his ruling’.<sup>3</sup> ‘Thus’, he<br>said to them, ‘did the Sages at Jamnia enunciate the ruling: If the woman did not delay more than the<br>time in which she can descend from the bed and wash her face,<sup>4</sup> this<sup>5</sup> is regarded as ‘within the time<br>limit’ and both are unclean on account of the doubt,<sup>6</sup> and exempt from bringing a sacrifice but they<br>are subject to the obligation of a suspensive guilt-offering. If she delayed for such a time during<br>which she could descend from the bed and wash her face,<sup>7</sup> this<sup>8</sup> is regarded as being ‘after the time’,<sup>9</sup><br>Similarly if she delayed<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> for twenty-four hours<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> or for a period between her previous and her<br>present examination,<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> the man who had intercourse with her is unclean on account of his contact,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup><br>but not on account of his intercourse.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> R. Akiba ruled: He also contracts uncleanness on the ground<br>of his intercourse.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> R. Judah son of R. Johanan b. Zakkai ruled: Her husband may enter the Temple<br>and burn incense.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> Now according to R. Hisda<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> one can well see why the Rabbis declare the man<br>clean, but according to R. Ashi<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> why do the Rabbis declare him clean? And should you reply that<br>this is a case where she did not have the rag in her hand<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> [it could be retorted:] Should not then<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> a<br>distinction have been made explicitly between the case where the woman had a rag in her hand and<br>where she had no rag in her hand?<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> — This is a difficulty.<br>‘R. Judah son of R. Johanan b. Zakkai ruled: Her husband may enter the Temple and burn<br>incense’. But why should not a prohibition be imposed<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> on the ground that the man came in contact<br>with a menstruant during the twenty-four hours of her retrospective uncleanness? — He<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> holds the<br>same view as Shammai who ruled: For all women it suffices to reckon their period of uncleanness<br>from the time of their discovering the flow.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> But should not a prohibition be imposed<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> on the<br>ground that the man has experienced an emission of semen? — This is a case where his intercourse<br>was not consummated.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup><br>THE SAGES, HOWEVER, AGREE WITH R. AKIBA THAT ONE WHO OBSERVED A<br>BLOODSTAIN. Rab explained: [She conveys UNCLEANNESS] retrospectively and the ruling is<br>that of R. Meir.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> Samuel, however, explained: [She conveys UNCLEANNESS] from now<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup><br>onwards and the ruling is that of the Rabbis. ‘From now onwards’! Would not this<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> be obvious? —<br>It might have been presumed that, since retrospective uncleanness for a period of twenty-four hours<br>is only a Rabbinical measure and the uncleanness of bloodstains at all times<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> is also only a<br>Rabbinical measure, as during the twenty-four hours’ period a woman does not convey uncleanness<br>to the man who had intercourse with her so also in the case of a stain<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> does she not convey<br>uncleanness to the man who had intercourse with her, hence we were informed [that she does convey<br>uncleanness to the man]. Might it not, however, be suggested that the law is so indeed?<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> — [No,<br>since] in the former case there is no slaughtered ox in your presence<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> but here there is a slaughtered<br>ox in your presence.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> Resh Lakish also explained in the same way<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> [that uncleanness is conveyed]<br>retrospectively and that the ruling is that of R. Meir. R. Johanan explained: [The uncleanness is<br>conveyed] from now onwards and the ruling is that of the Rabbis.<br><b>MISHNAH</b>. ALL WOMEN ARE IN THE CONDITION OF PRESUMPTIVE CLEANNESS FOR<br>THEIR HUSBANDS.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> FOR THOSE WHO RETURN FROM A JOURNEY THEIR WIVES ARE<br>IN THE CONDITION OF PRESUMPTIVE CLEANNESS.<br><b>GEMARA</b>. What need was there<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> to state,<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> THOSE THAT RETURN FROM A JOURNEY? —<br>It might have been presumed that this<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> applies only to a husband who was in the town, since in such<br>a case the woman thinks of her duties<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> and duly examines herself, but not to a husband who was not<br>in town since the question of [marital] duty does not occur to her, hence we were informed [that the<br>law applies to the latter case also). Resh Lakish in the name of R. Judah Nesi'ah<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> observed: But<br>this<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> applies only where the husband came and found her within her usually clean period.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> R. Huna<br>observed: This<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> was learnt only of a woman who had no settled period, but if she had a settled<br>period intercourse with her is forbidden.<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> Topsy turvy!<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> Does not, on the contrary, the reverse<br>stand to reason, since in the case of a woman who has no settled period it might well be assumed that<br>she experienced a discharge, but where she has a settled period [she should be presumed to be clean]<br>since her period was fixed? — Rather, if the statement was at all made it was made in the following<br>terms: R. Huna said, This<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> was learnt only in the case of a woman the time of whose settled period<br>had not arrived<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> but if that time had arrived<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> she is forbidden,<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> for he<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> is of the opinion that [the<br>laws of] settled periods<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> are Pentateuchal. Rabbah b. Bar Hana said: Even if the time of her settled<br>period has arrived she is also permitted,<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> for he is of the opinion that [the laws relating to] settled<br>period are only Rabbinical.<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> R. Ashi reported thus: R. Huna said,<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) For a period of twenty-four hours retrospectively.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) This (cf. prev. n.) being the only time limit recognized.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Sc. his time limit. Consequently they could not possibly have adopted it.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Sc. the time elapsed was no longer than that during which she can examine herself while still in bed.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) The discovery of a discharge within that space of time (cf. prev. n.).<br>(<sup>6</sup>) In agreement with R. Hisda supra.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) A period of time which is longer than the former (cf. supra n. <sup>1</sup>).<br>(<sup>8</sup>) The discharge discovered after the period mentioned (cf. prev. n.).<br>(<sup>9</sup>) I.e., ‘the interval following this interval’ as R. Hisda explained (supra <sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>b).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Longer than the periods mentioned.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) After intercourse.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) When the discharge was discovered.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) With the woman. Such a contact with a menstruant within the twenty-four hours’ period only subjects him to one<br>day's uncleanness until nightfall and the uncleanness is only Rabbinical and of an uncertain character.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) With a menstruant; sc. the uncleanness, even in its uncertain character, does not extend over seven days as would<br>have been the case with one who had intercourse with a confirmed menstruant.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) Cf. prev. n. mut. mut.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) This is explained infra.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Who explained supra that the interval within which SHE CAN DESCEND FROM THE BED is regarded as the<br>‘interval after this interval’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Who maintained supra that ‘the former and the latter represent the same length of time’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) So that after she descended from the bed she spent some more time in taking up the rag.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) In order to avoid the possible mistake that even within the shorter interval, when the woman had the rag in her hand,<br>the Rabbis hold the man to be clean.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Of course it should. Since no such distinction, however, is made it is obvious, is it not, that the Rabbis hold the man<br>to be clean even if the discharge was discovered after the interval in which the woman can descend from the bed with the<br>rag in her hand?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Lit., ‘and let (the prohibition) be inferred’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) R. Judah.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Supra <sup>2</sup>a.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) R. Akiba, however, maintains that the first stage of intercourse with a menstruant is regarded as its consummation,<br>and consequently uncleanness is conveyed even in such a case (Rashi).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Who in regard to bloodstains adopts (supra <sup>5</sup>a and infra <sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup>b) the more restrictive view.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) The time of the discovery of the stain.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) That the Rabbis agree she conveys uncleanness after the discovery of a stain (cf. prev. n.).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) Even after discovery.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) That she does not convey uncleanness to the one who had intercourse with her after the discovery of a bloodstain<br>just as she does not render him unclean retrospectively during the twenty-four hours prior to her having observed a<br>discharge.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Metaphor. Within the twenty-four hours prior to her having observed a discharge.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) Sc. the bloodstain had actually been discovered.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) As Rab supra.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) In respect of intercourse; sc. no examination is required for the purpose. It is necessary only for determining the<br>condition of any clean objects the woman may have handled.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) Lit., ‘wherefore to me’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) After the ruling in the first clause which applies to all husbands.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) The ruling in the first clause.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) Lit., ‘she throws upon herself’ —<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) The Prince, R. Judah II.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) The ruling in the final clause.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) I.e., within thirty days after her last observation of a discharge. After the thirty days, since most women have<br>monthly periods, intercourse must be preceded by an examination. (<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) That ‘within her usually clean period’ no<br>examination is required.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) Unless there was previous examination.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘towards where’ or towards the tail’ (cf. B.B. (Sonc. ed.) p. <sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>, n. <sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>).<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) That ‘within her usually clean period’ no examination is required.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) During the husband's absence from town.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) R. Huna.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup>) Sc. that when the date of a settled period arrives the woman is presumed to be in a state of doubtful uncleanness.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup>) No previous examination being required.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup>) Sc. the Rabbis required a woman to examine herself when the date of her settled period arrives in order to ascertain<br>whether there was a discharge or not. If, however, her husband was out of town and on his return it was unknown to him<br>whether she did or did not examine herself she is not to be regarded as being in a condition of doubtful uncleanness.",
        "This<sup>1</sup> was learnt only of a woman who had no settled period that was determinable by days alone but<br>one that was determinable by both days and leaps, so that since the period depends on some specific<br>act it might well be presumed, that she did not leap and that, therefore, did not observe any<br>discharge. Where, however, she has a settled period that was determinable by the days alone, she<br>must have no intercourse, for he is of the opinion that the restrictions relating to settled periods are<br>Pentateuchal. Rabbah b. Bar Hana ruled: Even if she has a settled period that was determined by the<br>days alone, she is permitted intercourse, for he holds the opinion that [the restrictions relating to]<br>settled periods are only Rabbinical.<br>R. Samuel citing R. Johanan ruled: If a woman has a settled period, her husband<sup>2</sup> may<sup>3</sup> calculate<br>the days of that period and<sup>4</sup> come in unto her.<sup>5</sup> Said R. Samuel b. Yeba to R. Abba: Did R. Johanan<br>refer also to a young wife who<sup>6</sup> is too shy to perform immersion? — The other replied: Did then R.<br>Johanan speak of one who had actually<sup>7</sup> observed a discharge? It may [in fact be held] that R.<br>Johanan spoke<sup>8</sup> only of a case where it is doubtful whether or not the woman did observe a discharge<br>and where, [so that] even if some reason could be found for assuming that she did observe one, it<br>may also be assumed that she had since performed immersions,<sup>9</sup> but in a case where it is certain that<br>she had observed a discharge, who could say that she had since performed immersion? And, seeing<br>that it is a question of a doubt<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> being opposed by a certainty<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> [she must be deemed unclean] since a<br>doubt cannot take one out of a certainty. But does it not? Was it not in fact taught: If a haber<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> died<br>and left a store-room full of fruits, even if they were only then due to be tithed,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> they are presumed<br>to have been properly prepared.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> Now here it is a case of certain tebel<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> and there is only the doubt<br>as to whether or not it was tithed, and the doubt nevertheless sets aside the certainty? — No, there it<br>is a case of a certainty against a certainty, in agreement with a statement of R. Hanina of Hozae,<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup><br>for R. Hanina of Hozae said: It is presumed with a haber that he does not allow anything to pass out<br>of his control unless it has been duly prepared. And if you prefer I might say: It is a case of doubt<br>against doubt, since [the man might have acted] in accordance with a suggestion of R. Oshaia, for R.<br>Oshaia said: A man<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> may resort to a device with his produce and store it<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> together with its chaff<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup><br>so that<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> his cattle may eat of it<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> and it is exempt from the tithe.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup><br>But does not a doubt set aside a certainty? Surely it has been taught: It once happened that the<br>handmaid of a certain tax-collector in Rimmon<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> threw the body of a premature child into a pit, and a<br>priest<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> came and gazed into it to ascertain whether it was male or female,<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> and when the matter<br>came before the Sages<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> they pronounced him clean because weasels and martens are commonly<br>found there.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> Now here, surely, it is a certainty that the woman had thrown a premature child into<br>the pit and a doubt whether they had dragged it away or not, and yet does not the doubt set aside the<br>certainty? — Do not read, ‘Threw the body of a premature child into a pit’ but<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) That the woman is presumed to be clean even if the date of her settled period had already arrived.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Having been out of town for seven days after that period.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) On returning home during the days in which she had the opportunity of performing immersion and attain cleanness.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Without asking her whether she had made use of her opportunity (cf. prev. n.).<br>(<sup>5</sup>) On the assumption that she had duly performed immersion and is now clean.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Unless urged by her husband.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Lit., ‘certainly’.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) That the woman need not be asked.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) And since R. Johanan's ruling is based on the existence of these doubts there can be no distinction between a younger<br>and an older woman.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) As to whether there was immersion in consequence of which she would be clean.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Of a discharge which renders her unclean.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) V. Glos.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘sons of their day’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) A.Z. <sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>b; i.e., that the priestly and levitical dues have been duly set aside for them.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) V. Glos. Since the fruit had reached a stage when it was liable to the dues (cf. prev. n.).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) A district on the eastern side of the Tigris.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Desirous of avoiding tithes.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Lit., ‘and brings it in’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Only corn that had been winnowed before it was brought into the store-room within the house is liable to tithe.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Since it was brought in unwinnowed (cf. prev. n.).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Even after its subsequent winnowing. A human being, though permitted to eat it in accordance with Pentateuchal<br>law, may not do so in accordance with a Rabbinic measure.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Even Rabbinically. Now since it is possible that the produce was taken to the store-room in accordance with R.<br>Oshaia's suggestion (a case of doubtful tebel) and it is also possible that it had been duly tithed, we have here a case of<br>doubt against doubt. As a haber is presumed not to allow anything to pass out of his hand unless it had been duly<br>prepared the Rabbis in this case waived aside their restriction and allowed a human being also to eat of the produce.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) A town near Jerusalem.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Who was ignorant of the laws of uncleanness (cf. Rashi's fourth interpretation and Tosaf.) and unaware that by<br>bending over the pit just above the embryo he would contract uncleanness.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) The period of a woman's uncleanness after childbirth is twice as long in the case of the latter as in that of the former<br>(cf. Lev. XII, <sup>2</sup>ff).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) To decide whether the priest contracted uncleanness by bending over the pit and thus ‘overshadowing’ the dead<br>body.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) In pits. Tosef. Oh. XVI. These creatures might be presumed to have devoured or dragged away the body so that<br>there was no ‘overshadowing’ on the part of the priest.",
        "‘a kind of premature child’.<sup>1</sup> But was it not stated, ‘To ascertain whether it was male or female’?<sup>2</sup> —<br>It is this that was meant: And a priest came and gazed into it to ascertain whether she had aborted an<br>inflated object or a premature child and, if some ground could be found for assuming that she<br>aborted a premature child, to ascertain whether it was male or female. And if you prefer I might<br>reply: Since weasels and martens are commonly found there they had certainly dragged it away.<sup>3</sup><br>An enquiry was addressed to<sup>4</sup> R. Nahman: [Is the examination at] regular menstrual periods<br>Pentateuchal<sup>5</sup> or only Rabbinical?<sup>6</sup> The latter replied: Since our colleague Huna citing Rab ruled, If a<br>woman who has a settled period did not make an examination when that period arrived but later on<sup>7</sup><br>observed a discharge, she must take into consideration the possibility [of a discharge] on the date of<br>the settled period,<sup>8</sup> and also the possibility of [twenty-four hours retrospective uncleanness] on<br>account of her observation.<sup>9</sup> Thus<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> it clearly follows that [the examination at] regular menstrual<br>periods is Pentateuchal. There are others who say that he<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> replied thus: The reason then<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> is that she<br>had ‘observed a discharge,’<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> but if she had not observed one the possibility<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> need not be taken into<br>consideration. Thus<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> it follows clearly that [the examination at] regular menstrual periods is only<br>Rabbinical.<br>It was stated: If a woman had a settled period, and when the time of that period arrived she did not<br>make the examination and later she did make one, Rab ruled: If on examination she found that she<br>was unclean she is unclean but if she found that she was clean she remains clean. Samuel, however,<br>ruled, Even if on examination she found herself clean she is deemed unclean, since the guest<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup><br>comes at the usual time. Must it be assumed that they<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> differ on [the question of the necessity for an<br>examination at] regular menstrual periods, one Master<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> holding that it is Pentateuchal<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> and the<br>other Master<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> maintaining that it is only Rabbinical?<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> R. Zera replied: Both<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> may agree that<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> [the<br>examination at] regular menstrual periods is Pentateuchal, but<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> one ruling<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> refers to a woman who<br>examined herself within the period of the duration of her menstruation<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> while the other<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> refers to a<br>woman who did not examine herself within the period of the duration of her menstruation.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> R.<br>Nahman b. Isaac maintained: They<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> differ on the very question of [the necessity for an examination<br>at] the regular menstrual periods, one Master<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> holding that it is Pentateuchal<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> while the other<br>Master<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> maintains that it is only Rabbinical.<br>R. Shesheth observed: [The discussion here] is analogous to that of the following Tannas: [For it<br>was taught:] R. Eliezer<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> ruled, She<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> is to be regarded as menstrually unclean,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> while R. Joshua<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup><br>ruled: Let her be examined.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> And these Tannas<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> differ on the same principle as the following<br>Tannas. For it was taught: R. Meir ruled, She<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> is to be regarded as menstrually unclean,<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> while the<br>Sages<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> ruled, Let her be examined.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> Abaye observed, We also learnt to the same effect. For we<br>learnt: R. Meir ruled, If a woman was in a hiding place<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> when the time of her regular period arrived<br>and she did not examine herself, she is nevertheless clean, because fear suspends the menstrual<br>flow.<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> The reason then<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> is that there was fear, but if there had been no fear she would have been<br>deemed unclean. Thus it clearly follows [that the necessity for an examination at] regular periods is<br>Pentateuchal. May it be assumed that the following Tannas also differ on the same principle? For it<br>was taught: If a woman observed some blood [that might be] due to a wound,<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> even if this occurred<br>during her usual period of menstruation, she is deemed to be clean;<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> so R. Simeon b. Gamaliel.<br>Rabbi ruled: If she has a regular period<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> she<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> must take her period into consideration.<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> Now do<br>they not differ on this principle, one Master<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> holding that [the examinations at] the regular periods<br>are Pentateuchal, while the other Master<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> holds that they are only Rabbinical? — Rabina replied:<br>No; both may agree that [the examinations at] the regular periods are only Rabbinical, but it is on the<br>question whether the interior of the uterus is unclean<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> that they differ. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel holds<br>that the woman is clean<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> but the blood<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> is unclean because it comes through the uterus,<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> and<br>Rabbi<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> in effect said to him: If<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> you take into consideration the possibility of her usual menstrual<br>flow, the woman also should be unclean,<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> and if<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> you do not take into consideration the possibility<br>of her usual menstrual flow, [the blood also should be clean since] the interior of the uterus<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> is<br>clean.<br><b>MISHNAH</b>.

        "GEMARA. Our Rabbis taught: Although [the Sages] have said, ‘He who has intercourse in the light<br>of a lamp is contemptible’,<sup>1</sup> Beth Shammai ruled: A woman needs two<sup>2</sup> testing-rags for every<br>intercourse<sup>3</sup> or she must perform it in the light of a lamp, but Beth Hillel ruled: Two testing-rags<br>suffice for her for the whole night.<br>It was taught: Beth Shammai said to Beth Hillel, ‘According to your view<sup>4</sup> is there no need to<br>provide against the possibility that she might emit<sup>5</sup> a drop of blood of the size of a mustard seed in<br>the course of the first act and this would be covered up with semen during the second act?’<sup>6</sup> ‘But’,<br>replied Beth Hillel, even according to your view<sup>7</sup> is there no need to provide against the possibility<br>that the spittle,<sup>8</sup> while still in the mouth,<sup>9</sup> was crushed out of existence?’<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> ‘[We maintain our view,]<br>the former retorted, ‘because what is crushed once is not the same as that which is crushed twice’.<br>It was taught: R. Joshua stated, ‘I approve<sup>5</sup> of the view of Beth Shammai’.<sup>7</sup> ‘Master’, said his<br>disciples to him, ‘what an extension [of the restrictions] you have imposed upon us!’ ‘It is a good<br>thing’, he replied, ‘that I should impose extensive restrictions upon you in this world in order that<br>your days may be prolonged in the world to come.<br>R. Zera remarked: From the words of all these authorities<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> we may infer<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> that a conscientious<br>man should not indulge in intercourse twice in succession.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> Raba said: One may indulge in<br>intercourse twice in succession, for that ruling<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> was taught only in respect of clean objects.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> So it<br>was also taught: This<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> applies only to clean objects<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> but to her husband she is permitted.<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> This,<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup><br>however, applies only where he had left her in a state of presumptive cleanness, but if he left her in a<br>state of presumptive uncleanness she is presumed to be in that state forever until she tells him, ‘I am<br>clean’.<br>R. Abba citing R. Hiyya b. Ashi who had it from Rab ruled: If a woman<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> examined herself with a<br>testing-rag which was subsequently lost she is forbidden intercourse until she had reexamined<br>herself. R. Ela demurred: If it had not been lost<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> would she not<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> have been allowed intercourse<br>even though she is unaware [whether there was or there was not a discharge], why then should she<br>not now also<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> be allowed intercourse? — Raba replied: In the former case her proof is in<br>existence,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> but in the latter case<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> her proof is not in existence.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup><br>R. Johanan stated: It is forbidden to perform one's marital duty in the day-time.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> What is the<br>Scriptural proof? That it is said, Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night wherein it was<br>said: ‘A man-child is brought forth’.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> The night is thus set aside<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> for conception but the day is not<br>set aside for conception. Resh Lakish stated: [The proof is] from here: But he that despiseth His<br>ways<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> shall die.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> As to Resh Lakish, how does he expound R. Johanan's text?<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> — He requires it<br>for the same exposition as that made by R. Hanina b. Papa. For R. Hanina b. Papa made the<br>following exposition: The name of the angel who is in charge of conception is ‘Night’, and he takes<br>up a drop and places it in the presence of the Holy One, blessed be He, saying, ‘Sovereign of the<br>universe, what shall be the fate of this drop? Shall it produce a strong man or a weak man, a wise<br>man or a fool, a rich man or a poor man?’ Whereas ‘wicked man’ or ‘righteous one’ he does not<br>mention, in agreement with the view of R. Hanina. For R. Hanina stated: Everything is in the hands<br>of heaven except the fear of God, as it is said, And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require<br>of thee, but to fear etc.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> And R. Johanan?<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> — If that were the only meaning,<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> Scripture should<br>have written,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> ‘A man-child is brought forth’<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> why then was it stated, ‘was brought forth a<br>man-child’?<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> To indicate that the night<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> is set aside for conception<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> but the day is not set aside for<br>conception. As to R. Johanan how does he expound the text of Resh Lakish?<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> — He requires it for<br>[an application to the same types] as those described in the Book of Ben Sira:<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> ‘There are three<br>[types] that I hate, yea, four that I do not love: A Scholar<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> who frequents wine-shops<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> [or, as others<br>say, a scholar that is a gossip],<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> a person who sets up a college in the high parts of a town,<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> one<br>who holds the membrum when making water and one who enters his friend's house suddenly’.<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> R.<br>Johanan observed:<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> Even his own house.<br>R. Simeon b. Yohai observed: There are four [types]<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> which the Holy One, blessed be He, hates,<br>and as for me, I do not love them: The man who enters his house suddenly and much more so [if he<br>so enters] his friend's house, the man who holds the membrum when he makes water,<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) The reason is given infra.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Previously unused.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) V. supra p. <sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup><sup>8</sup>, n. <sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) That there is no need for a testing-rag after every act.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Lit., ‘see’.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) So that the test after that act would not reveal it.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) That testing-rags must be used after each act.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Sc. a drop of blood.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Euphemism; the uterus; i.e., during the first intercourse.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) So that the test after that act would not reveal it.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Lit., ‘all of them’, even Beth Hillel who requires only one test after the last act.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Since intercourse is presumed lo be the possible cause of a discharge.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) If there was no examination after the first act.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) That each or, at least, the last intercourse must be followed by an examination.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) Sc. to make sure that the woman did not convey to them uncleanness when handling them. As regards intercourse,<br>however, when a woman is in a presumptive state of cleanness no examination is necessary.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) That each or, at least, the last intercourse must be followed by an examination.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Even in the absence of an examination.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) That as regards her husband no examination is required.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) At night, before intercourse.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Lit., ‘it is’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Since the examination of the rags, according to Beth Hillel, is never to take place before the following morning and,<br>even according to Beth Shammai, no lamp is required at night and the examination is equally postponed until the<br>morning whenever two rags are used for each act.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Where the rag is lost.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) And it may well be examined in the morning to ascertain, regarding clean objects the woman had handled, whether<br>she is clean or unclean. As regards intercourse too, should it be found that her uncleanness began prior to the act, she<br>could bring a sin-offering.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Were intercourse to be allowed in such a case there would be no possible means of ascertaining the condition of the<br>woman any more than if there had been no examination at all.

        "the man who when naked makes water in front of his bed, and the man who has intercourse in the<br>presence of any living creature. ‘Even’, said Rab Judah to Samuel, ‘in the presence of mice?’<br>‘Shinena’,<sup>1</sup> the other replied, ‘no; but [the reference is to] a house like that of So and so where they<br>have intercourse in the presence of their men-servants and maidservants.<sup>2</sup> But what was the<br>exposition they made? — Abide ye here with<sup>3</sup> the ass,<sup>4</sup> implies: peoples that are like an ass. Rabbah<br>son of R. Huna used to chase away the wasps from his curtained bed.<sup>5</sup> Abaye drove away the flies.<sup>6</sup><br>Rabba<sup>7</sup> chased away the mosquitoes.<sup>6</sup><br>R. Simeon b. Yohai stated, There are five things which [cause the man] who does them to forfeit<br>his life and his blood is upon his own head: Eating<sup>8</sup> peeled garlic, a peeled onion or a peeled egg, or<br>drinking diluted liquids that<sup>9</sup> were kept over night; spending a night in a graveyard; removing one's<br>nails and throwing them away in a public thoroughfare; and blood-letting followed immediately by<br>intercourse.<br>‘Eating peeled garlic etc.’ Even though they are deposited in a basket and tied up and sealed, an<br>evil spirit rests upon them. This, however, has been said only where their roots or peel did not<br>remain<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> with them, but if their roots or peel remained with them there can be no objection.<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> ‘And<br>drinking diluted liquids that were kept over night’. Rab Judah citing Samuel explained: This applies<br>only where they were kept over night in a metal vessel. R. Papa stated: Vessels made of alum<br>crystals are the same in this respect as vessels made of metal. So also said R. Johanan: This applies<br>only where they were kept in a metal vessel; and vessels made of alum crystals are the same in this<br>respect as vessels made of metal.<br>‘Spending a night in a graveyard’, in order that a spirit of uncleanness may rest upon him.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> [This<br>should not be done] since in consequence he might sometimes be exposed to danger.<br>‘Removing one's nails and throwing them away in a public thoroughfare’. [This is dangerous]<br>because a pregnant woman passing over them would miscarry. This, however, has been said only of<br>a case where one removes them with a pair of scissors. Furthermore, this has been said only of a case<br>where one removes the nails of both hands and feet. Furthermore, this has been said only in the case<br>where one did not cut anything immediately after cutting them but if something was cut immediately<br>after they were cut there can be no danger.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> This, however, is not [to be relied upon]. One should be<br>on his guard in all the cases mentioned.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: Three things have been said about the disposal of nails: He who burns them is<br>a pious man, he who buries them is a righteous man, and he who throws them away is a wicked<br>man.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup><br>‘And blood-letting followed immediately by intercourse’. [This should be avoided] because a<br>Master said: If a man has intercourse immediately after being bled, he will have feeble<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> children;<br>and if intercourse took place after both husband and wife have been bled, they will have children<br>afflicted with ra'athan.<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> Rab<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> stated: This has been said only in the case where nothing was tasted<br>after the bleeding but if something was tasted after it there can be no harm.<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup><br>R. Hisda ruled: A man is forbidden to perform his marital duty in the day-time, for it is said, But<br>thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> But what is the proof? — Abaye replied: He might<br>observe something repulsive in her and she would thereby become loathsome to him.<br>R. Huna said, Israel are holy and do not perform their marital duties in the day-time. Raba said,<br>But in<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> a dark house this is permitted; and a scholar<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> may darken a room with his cloak and<br>perform his marital duty. [But] we have learnt, OR SHE MUST PERFORM IT IN THE LIGHT OF<br>A LAMP? — Read: SHE MUST examine IT IN THE LIGHT OF A LAMP.<br>Come and hear: Although [the Sages] have said, He who has intercourse in the light of a lamp is<br>loathsome [etc.]?<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> — Read: He who examines his bed<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> in the light of a lamp is loathsome.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup><br>Come and hear: And the people of the house of Monobaz<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> did three things, and on account of<br>these they were honourably mentioned: They performed their marital duties in the day-time, they<br>examined their beds with cotton,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> and they observed the rules of uncleanness and cleanness in the<br>case of snow. At all events, was it not here stated, ‘They performed their marital duties in the<br>day-time’? Read: They examined their beds in the day-time. This may also be supported by logical<br>argument. For if one were to imagine [that the reading is] ‘performed their marital duties’, would<br>they have been ‘honourably mentioned’? — Yes, indeed;<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> because owing to the prevalence<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> of<br>sleep<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> she is likely to become repulsive to him.<br>‘They examined their beds with cotton.’ This provides support for a ruling of Samuel. For Samuel<br>ruled: The bed<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> may be examined only with cotton tufts or with clean and soft wool. Rab observed:<br>This explains what they said in Palestine<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> on Sabbath eves,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> when I was there, ‘Who requires<br>cotton tufts for his bread’,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> and I did not understand at the time what they meant.<br>Raba stated: Old flax garments are admirably suited for examination purposes. But can this be<br>correct,<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> seeing that the school of Manasseh taught: The bed<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> may not be examined either with a<br>red rag or with a black one or with flax,<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> but only with cotton tufts or with clean and soft wool?<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup><br>This is no difficulty, since the latter refers to flax while the former refers to garments of flax. And if<br>you prefer I might reply: Both refer to garments of flax but the latter deals with new ones while the<br>former deals with old ones.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup><br>‘They observed the rules of uncleanness and cleanness in the case of snow.’ We learnt elsewhere:<br>Snow is neither a food nor a drink. Though one intended to use it as food it is not subject to the laws<br>of the uncleanness of foodstuffs,<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> [but if one intended to use it] as a drink it is subject to the laws of<br>the uncleanness of drinks.

Johanan stated: In three instances<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> did the Sages follow the majority rule<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> and treated them as<br>certainties, viz., the ‘source’, the ‘placenta’ and the ‘piece’. The ‘source’? The case already spoken<br>of.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> The ‘placenta’? Concerning which we have learnt: If a placenta<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> is within a house, the house is<br>unclean;<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> and this is so not because a placenta is regarded as a child but because generally there is<br>no placenta without a child in it.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> R.

        "and miscarried<sup>1</sup> in it, she must bring a sacrifice which may be eaten, since we follow the majority of<br>women, and the majority of women bear normal children?<sup>2</sup> — We spoke of Tannaitic rulings;<sup>3</sup> we<br>did not discuss reported traditions.<sup>4</sup> But, surely, when Rabin came<sup>5</sup> he stated, ‘R.

Meir declares the<br>dough clean, but the Sages declare it unclean because it is the nature of a child to slap<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> [dough]’;<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup><br>and when it was asked, ‘What is R.

Oshaia stated: This is a presumption<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> on the strength of<br>which terumah is burnt,<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> while R. Johanan stated, This<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> is not a presumption on the strength of<br>which terumah is burnt?<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> — It<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> was rather intended to exclude the rule of majority of which R.<br>Judah spoke.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> For we learnt: If a woman aborted a shapeless object,<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> if there was blood with it she<br>is unclean<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> otherwise she is clean; R. Judah ruled: In either case she is unclean.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> And in connection<br>with this Rab Judah citing Samuel stated: R. Judah declared the woman unclean only where the<br>shapeless object had the colour of one of the four kinds of blood,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> but if it had that of any other<br>kinds of blood<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> the woman is clean, while R. Johanan stated: [If it had the colour] of one of the four<br>kinds of blood<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> all<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> agree that she is unclean, and if it had that of any other kinds of blood all agree<br>that she is clean; they<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> differ only in the case where she aborted something<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) In consequence of which it is unknown whether or not the miscarriage was a developed child.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Infra <sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>a. Now since her sacrifice, a bird sin-offering (the method of whose killing by pinching would have caused<br>an unconsecrated, or doubtfully consecrated bird to be nebelah), may be eaten, it follows that the bird is deemed to be<br>duly consecrated because, by reason of the majority rule, the woman's doubtful birth is regarded as a certain birth of a<br>normal child. Why then did not R. Johanan mention this case which concerns a woman's uncleanness?<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘our Mishnah’, sc. rulings occurring in a Mishnah or a Baraitha.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Of Amoras. R. Joshua b.

Joshua b. Levi's ruling. Since the answer is presumably in the affirmative the ruling given here in the name of<br>R. Joshua b. Levi has its origin in a Baraitha. Why then, since it is a case of the uncleanness of a woman and is also a<br>Tannaitic ruling, was it not included among those cited supra by R. Johanan?<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) R. Johanan's limitation of the instances supra to three.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) I.e., what other doubtful instance is there that, despite the majority rule, is not treated as a certainty?<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Of a woman's uncleanness.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘there . . . with it’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Being doubtfully unclean.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) Sc. on account of the doubtful uncleanness.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Explicitly, in other cases of uncleanness.

Tosaf.).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) As is any dough, unless the contrary is proved.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Of children who do not slap dough and, therefore, cannot impart to it their uncleanness (so according to Tosaf.).<br>Aliter: Who do not dabble in the rubbish heap and, therefore, contract no uncleanness (according to Rashi).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) The dough is presumed to be clean (cf. prev. n. but one).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) That ‘most children slap dough’ or ‘dabble in the rubbish heap’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) By the major force of two to one.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Sc. that it is a child's nature to slap dough (Rashi).

Now, since R.

Johanan's limitation supra to three instances.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) Sc. that in that case the uncleanness which is dependent on the majority rule is not regarded as a certainty. It is only<br>one of a doubtful character and, in consequence, terumah that is subject to such uncleanness may not be burnt.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) Lit., ‘piece’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) As a menstruant.

It is impossible in his opinion for an abortion to be free from all blood, though the latter might sometimes<br>escape attention.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) Described in the Mishnah infra <sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>a, as unclean. Black and red blood are here regarded as of the same colour, the<br>latter being a deteriorated form of the former. The Mishnah treating them as two gives the total number of kinds of<br>unclean blood as five. In R. Judah's opinion the colour of unclean blood is proof that the entire mass is a piece of clotted<br>blood. Hence the woman's menstrual uncleanness. The Rabbis, however, do not regard it as blood but as a shapeless<br>piece of flesh.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) Green or white, for instance.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) Cf. prev. n. but one.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) Even the Rabbis.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) The Rabbis and R.

Whence is it deduced that there is clean discharge of blood in a woman? Is it not<br>possible that all blood that issues from her is unclean? — R. Hama b. Joseph citing R. Oshaia<sup>7</sup><br>replied: Scripture says, If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and<br>blood,<sup>8</sup> which implies between clean blood and unclean blood. But then, would the expression<br>‘between a leprous stroke and a leprous stroke’<sup>8</sup> also mean between an unclean stroke and a clean<br>one? And should you reply: This is so indeed, [it could be retorted:] Is there at all a leprous stroke<br>that is clean? And should you reply, ‘It is all turned white; he is clean’,<sup>9</sup> [it could be retorted:] That<br>is called a white scurf!<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> Consequently it must mean: Between human leprosy and the leprosy of<br>houses and the leprosy of garments, all of which are unclean; why then should it not be said heres<br>also that the distinction implied is that between the blood of a menstruant and that of one suffering<br>from gonorrhoea both of which are unclean?<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> — What a comparison! There<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> [the controversy<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> is<br>well justified<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> since] a difference of opinion might arise in the case of human leprosy on the lines of<br>that between R. Joshua and the Rabbis. For we have learnt: If the bright spot<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> preceded the white<br>hair, he<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> is unclean; if the reverse was the case, he is clean. If [the order of appearance is] a matter<br>of doubt he is unclean; but R. Joshua said: It is as though darkened,<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> and in connection with this<br>Rabbah explained: It is as though [the spot] darkened<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> and he is therefore clean.<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> As regards<br>leprosy in houses the point at issue<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> may be the one between R. Eleazar son of R. Simeon and the<br>Rabbis. For we have learnt: R. Eleazar son of R. Simeon ruled: A house never becomes unclean<br>unless the leprosy appears in the size of two beans on two stones,<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> in two walls,<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> at a corner,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> and<br>it must be two beans in length and one bean in breadth.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> What is R. Eleazar son of R. Simeon's<br>reason? — It is written<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> wall<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> and it is also written walls,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> now what wall is it that is like two<br>walls? Admit that that is a corner.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> As regards leprosy in garments the divergence of opinion<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> may<br>be the one between R. Jonathan b. Abtolemos and the Rabbis. For it was taught: R. Jonathan<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> b.<br>Abtolemos stated, Whence is it deduced that leprosy that is spread over entire garments is clean?<br>Since karahath<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> and gabahath<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> are mentioned in respect of garments, and karahath<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> and<br>gabahath<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> are also mentioned in the case of human beings, as in the latter case if the leprosy spread<br>over the whole body, he is clean so also in the former case if it spread over the whole garment it is<br>clean.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> Here,<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> however, if clean blood does not exist, what could be the point at issue between<br>them?<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> But whence is it inferred that these kinds of blood are clean and the others are unclean?<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> —<br>R. Abbahu replied: Since Scripture says, And the Moabites saw the water as red as blood,<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> which<br>indicates that blood is red.<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> Might it not be suggested that only red blood<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> is unclean but no<br>other?<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> — R. Abbahu replied: Scripture says; Her blood,<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> Her blood<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> implying four kinds.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> But<br>have we not learnt, FIVE KINDS? — R. Hanina replied: Black blood is really red [blood] that had<br>deteriorated.<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> So it was also taught: Black blood is like the sediment of ink; if it is dark it is unclean,<br>and if lighter, even though it has the colour of stibium, it is clean. And black blood is not black<br>originally. It<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> assumes the black colour only after it is discharged, like the blood of a wound which<br>becomes black after it had been discharged from it.<br>BETH SHAMMAI RULED: ALSO A COLOUR LIKE THAT OF FENUGREEK. But do not<br>Beth Shammai uphold the deduction from, Her blood,<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> her blood<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> which imply four kinds?<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> — If<br>you wish I may reply that they do not uphold it — And if you prefer I may reply that they do uphold<br>it, but<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> did not R. Hanina explain, ‘Black blood is really red [blood] that had deteriorated’?<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> Well,<br>here also<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> it may be explained that [the blood]<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> had merely deteriorated.<br>BUT BETH HILLEL DECLARE THESE CLEAN.

R.<br>Johanan, by his limitation to three (supra <sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>a) of the cases in which the majority rule is given the force of a certainty, has<br>implicitly indicated that, in the case dealt with by R.

If so, instead of saying, EVEN IF IT DOES NOT CONVEY<br>UNCLEANNESS AS A BLOODSTAIN IT CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS AS A LIQUID, should he<br>not have said ‘on account of her observation’?<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> — Rather, it is this that he in effect said to them,<br>‘Granted that where the woman observed yellow blood at the outset you do not<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> regard her as<br>unclean;<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> where she observed first red blood<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> and then a yellow discharge the latter also must be<br>deemed unclean,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> since it is something like the liquids<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> of a zab or a zabah’.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> And the Rabbis?<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup><br>— [An unclean liquid must be] similar to spittle; as spittle is formed in globules when it is<br>discharged so must any other unclean liquid be one that is formed in globules when it is discharged;<br>that liquid<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> is therefore excluded since it is not formed in globules when discharged. If so, do not<br>the Rabbis indeed give R.

Abba ruled: In the case of all these<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> if the discharge is darker<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> it is clean and if<br>it is lighter it is also clean, the only exception being black;<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> and it is in this case that the Rabbinical<br>standard is of use.<br>Bar Kappara ruled: In the case of all these<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> if the discharge is darker it is unclean and if lighter it<br>is clean, the exception being [the colour of] diluted wine in which a darker shade is clean and a<br>lighter one is also clean. Bar Kappara was shown a lighter shade<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> and he declared it clean, and<br>when he was shown a darker shade<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> he also declared it clean. ‘How great is the man’, exclaimed R.<br>Hanina, ‘who in practice acts<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> in agreement with his view.<br>A COLOUR LIKE BRIGHT CROCUS. A Tanna taught: Fresh crocus and not dry one. One<br>[Baraitha] taught: Like the lower leaf<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> but not like the upper one, and another [Baraitha] taught:<br>Like the upper leaf but not like the lower one, while a third [Baraitha] taught: Like the upper leaf and<br>much more so like the lower one, and a fourth [Baraitha] taught: Like the lower leaf and much more<br>so like the upper one!<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> — Abaye replied: The crocus has three rows of leaves<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> and there are three<br>leaves in each row; keep<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> to the middle row<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> and the middle leaf of that row.<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> When they came<br>before R. Abbahu he told them: What we learnt [about the colour of the crocus refers to such as are<br>still] attached to their clods.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup><br>OR LIKE EARTHY WATER. Our Rabbis taught: Like earthy water — one brings fertile soil<br>from the valley of Beth Kerem over which he causes water to float; so R. Meir. R. Judah<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> said:<br>From the valley of Jotapata.<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> R. Jose said: From the valley of Sikni.<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> R. Simeon said: Also from<br>the valley of Gennesaret<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> and similar soil. Another [Baraitha] taught: And like earthy water — one<br>brings fertile soil from the valley of Beth Kerem and over it he causes water to float until it forms a<br>layer as thin as the husk of garlic; and no quantity has been prescribed for the water since none has<br>been prescribed for the earth.<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> The water, furthermore, is not to be examined when it is clean but<br>when turbid. If they become clear they must be stirred up again;<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> and when they are stirred one<br>must not do it with the hand but with a vessel. The question was raised: [Does the expression,] ‘One<br>must not do it with the hand but with a vessel’ mean that a man must not put it in his hand and stir it<br>in it but that where it is in a vessel it is quite proper for him to stir it with his hand, or is it possible<br>that the meaning is that one must not stir it with his hand<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> but with an instrument?<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> — Come and<br>hear: When he examines it<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> he must do it in a cup only.<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> But does not the question yet remain: If<br>the examination must be in a cup, wherewith must the stirring be done? — This is undecided.<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup><br>When they came before Rabba b. Abbuha he told them: What we learnt [about the earth refers to<br>such as is] in its own place.<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup><br>R.

        "for R. Hanina was wise enough;<sup>1</sup> all others are not so wise. R. Johanan remarked: The wisdom of R.<br>Hanina caused me not to examine any blood, for when I declared any unclean he declared it clean<br>and when I declared it clean he declared it unclean. R. Eleazar remarked: R. Hanina's modesty is the<br>cause of my examining blood. [For I felt] if R. Hanina who was modest allowed himself to be<br>involved in doubt and examined blood, should not I examine it? R. Zera remarked: The Babylonian<br>coinage was the cause of my refusing to examine blood; for I thought: If I do not understand the<br>coinage system would I understand the nature of blood? This then implies that capability to examine<br>blood depends on an understanding of the coinage; but did not Rabbah in fact understand the coinage<br>system and yet did not understand the qualities of blood? — He was really drawing an inference a<br>minori ad majus: If Rabbah who understood the coinage system refused to examine blood, should I<sup>2</sup><br>examine it?<br>‘Ulla once visited Pumbeditha<sup>3</sup> and when some blood was brought to him for examination he<br>refused to see it. If, he said, R. Eleazar who was the supreme authority in the Land of Israel<sup>4</sup> refused<br>to see blood whenever he visited the place of R. Judah, should I see it?<sup>5</sup> And why was he described<br>as the supreme authority in the Land of Israel? — Because a woman once brought some blood before<br>R. Eleazar when R. Ammi sat in his presence. Having smelt it he<sup>6</sup> told her, ‘This is blood of lust’.<sup>7</sup><br>After she went out R. Ammi joined her and she told him, ‘My husband was away on a journey but I<br>felt an intense longing for him’. Thereupon he<sup>8</sup> applied to him<sup>6</sup> the text, The counsel of the Lord is<br>with them that fear Him.<sup>9</sup><br>Ifra Hormiz,<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> the mother of King Shapur, once sent some blood to Raba when R. Obadiah was<br>sitting in his presence. Having smelt it he said to him, ‘This is blood of lust’.<sup>7</sup> ‘Come and see’, she<br>remarked to her<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> son, ‘how wise the Jews are’. ‘It is quite possible’, he replied, ‘that he<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> hit upon it<br>like a blind man on a window’. Thereupon she sent to him<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> sixty different kinds of blood and he<br>identified them all but the last one which was lice blood with which he was not acquainted.<br>Luckily,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> however, he sent her<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> a comb that exterminates lice. ‘O, you Jews’, she exclaimed, you<br>seem to live in the inner chamber of one's heart’.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup><br>Rab Judah stated: ‘At first I used to examine blood, but since the mother of my son Isaac told me,<br>\"We do not bring the first drop to the Rabbis because it is dirty\", I refuse to see it.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> [An<br>examination, however, for the purpose of distinguishing] between the blood of uncleanness and<br>cleanness<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> I certainly do perform’.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup><br>Yaltha<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> once brought some blood to Rabbah b. Bar Hana who informed her that it was unclean.<br>She then took it to R. Isaac the son of Rab Judah who told her that it was clean. But how could he act<br>in this manner, seeing that is was taught: If a Sage declared [aught] unclean another Sage<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> may not<br>declare it clean; if he forbade anything his colleague may not permit it?<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> — At first he<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> informed<br>her indeed that it was unclean,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> but when she told him that on every other occasion he<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> declared<br>such blood as clean, but that on the last occasion he had a pain in his eye, he gave her his ruling that<br>it was clean. But are women believed in such circumstances? — Yes, and so it was also taught: A<br>woman<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> is believed when she says, ‘I saw a kind of blood like this one<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> but I have lost it.’<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup><br>The question was raised: What is the law [where a woman says], A kind of blood like this<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> has<br>been declared clean by such and such a Sage?<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> — Come and hear: A woman<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> is believed when she<br>says, ‘I saw a kind of blood like this one<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> but I have lost it.’<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> But is not that case<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> different, since<br>the blood is not available?<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> — Come and hear the case of Yaltha: She once brought some blood to<br>Rabbah b. Bar Hana who informed her that it was unclean. She then took it<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> to R. Isaac the son of<br>Rab Judah who told her that it was clean. But how could he act in this manner, seeing that it was<br>taught: If a Sage declared [a person or an article] unclean no other Sage<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> may declare it clean etc.<br>And we explained that at first he<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> informed her indeed that it was unclean, but when she told him<br>that on every other occasion he<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> declared such blood as clean but that on that day he had a pain in<br>his eye, he changed his view and gave her his ruling that it was clean.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> Now this proves quite<br>clearly, does it not, that a woman is believed? — R. Isaac b. Judah may have relied on his own<br>traditions and experience.<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup><br>Rabbi once examined some blood at night and declared it unclean but when he examined it in the<br>day time he declared it clean. Then he waited a while and again declared it unclean. ‘Woe to me’, he<br>said, ‘I may have made a mistake’.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> ‘I may have made a mistake’! Has he not in fact made a<br>mistake, seeing that it was taught: A Sage must not say,<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> ‘If it had been moist it would undoubtedly<br>have been unclean’; he must rather say, ‘The judge must be guided only by what his eyes see’? — At<br>first<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> he presumed it to be definitely unclean, but when he observed in the morning that its colour<br>had changed<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> he said<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> that it was undoubtedly clean but that at night it could not be seen properly.<br>When, however, he observed that the colour had changed again<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> he said, ‘It must be unclean blood<br>but the colour is steadily fading away.<br>Rabbi examined blood in the light of a lamp. R. Ishmael son of R. Joseph<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> examined it even on a<br>cloudy day between the pillars.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> R. Ammi b.

Johanan, however, stated: [If the object had the colour] of one of<br>the four kinds of blood<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> all<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> agree that the woman is unclean and if it had the colour of any of the<br>other kinds of blood all<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> agree that she is clean; they<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> differ only in the case where she aborted<br>something and she does not know what she aborted.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> [In such a case.] R. Judah holds, one must be<br>guided by the nature of most of shapeless objects, and most shapeless objects have the colour of one<br>of the four kinds of blood, while the Rabbis hold that we do not say, ‘most shapeless objects have the<br>colour of one of the four kinds of blood’. But is this correct?<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> Surely when R. Hoshaia arrived from<br>Nehardea he came [to the schoolhouse] and brought with him a Baraitha: If a woman aborted a<br>shapeless object that was red, black, green or white,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> if there was blood with it, she is unclean,<br>otherwise she is clean. R. Judah ruled: In either case she is unclean. Now does not this present a<br>difficulty against Samuel in one respect and against R. Johanan in two respects? ‘Against Samuel in<br>one respect, since Samuel stated, ‘R. Judah declared the woman unclean only where the shapeless<br>object had the colour of one of the four kinds of blood’ whereas here ‘green and white’<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> were<br>mentioned and R. Judah nevertheless disagrees.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> And were you to reply that R. Judah differs only in<br>respect of red and black but not in that of green or white [the question would arise:] For whose<br>benefit then was green and white mentioned? If it be suggested: For that of the Rabbis,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> [it could be<br>retorted:] Since the Rabbis declared the woman clean even in the case of red and black blood,<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> was<br>it any longer necessary to state that the same law applies also to green and white?<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> Must it not then<br>be conceded that these<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> were mentioned for the benefit of R. Judah<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> who, it thus follows, does<br>differ.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> Furthermore, according to R. Johanan<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> who also stated, ‘[If it had the colour] of one of the<br>four kinds of blood all agree that she is unclean’, [the additional difficulty arises:] Were not red and<br>black also mentioned and the Rabbis nevertheless differ.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> And should you reply that the Rabbis<br>differ only in regard to green and white but not in that of red and black [the difficulty would arise:]<br>For whose benefit, then, were red and black mentioned? If it be suggested: For that of R. Judah [it<br>could be retorted:] Since green and white are regarded as unclean, was it at all necessary to mention<br>red and black? Must it not then be conceded that these were mentioned for the benefit of the Rabbis<br>who, it follows, do differ?<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> — Rather, explained R. Nahman b. Isaac: The point at issue between<br>them<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> is the question whether it is possible for the uterus<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> to open<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> without bleeding.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> They<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup><br>thus differ on the same principle as that on which the following Tannas differ.

R. Judah holds that the shapeless object is but a piece of clotted blood. Hence, if its<br>colour is that of unclean blood, the woman, though not in childbirth, must be deemed unclean as a menstruant.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) White or green, for instance.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Since she is neither in childbirth nor a menstruant.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Cf. supra n. <sup>2</sup>.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) Even the Rabbis.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Even R.

Judah regards the woman as unclean.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) From the Rabbis. How then could Samuel maintain that in such cases R. Judah regards the woman as clean?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) Against whom, since he stated that in the case of the other kinds of blood ‘all agree that she is clean’, the difficulty<br>just pointed out against Samuel equally applies.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) From R.

Judah and the Rabbis.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) Lit., ‘grave’.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) When an embryo or any other object passes out.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) Blood of labour. Both R. Judah and the Rabbis regard the shapeless object as a piece of flesh, and not as a mass of<br>congealed blood. Hence whatever its colour the woman cannot be regarded as a menstruant. R. Judah, however,<br>maintains that the uterus never opens without some bleeding though this may sometimes escape observation. The woman<br>is, therefore, unclean on account of the inevitable discharge of the blood of labour even though the object was green or<br>white and no blood whatsoever had been observed. The Rabbis, on the other hand, maintain that the uterus sometimes<br>opens without any accompanying bleeding and the woman is, therefore, clean whenever no discharge is observed.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) Within the eleven days’ period intervening between the menstrual periods.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) Besides being uncertain whether the abortion was accompanied by bleeding.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) Sc. whether it was an embryo or a mere lump of flesh.",
        "her case is one of doubtful childbirth and doubtful zibah, and<sup>1</sup> she must, therefore, bring a sacrifice<sup>2</sup><br>which may not be eaten.<sup>3</sup> R. Joshua ruled: She must bring a sacrifice and it may be eaten, since it is<br>impossible for the uterus to open without some bleeding.<sup>4</sup><br>Another version reads as follows. Rab Judah citing Samuel stated: R. Judah declared the woman<br>unclean only where the object had the colour of one of the four kinds of blood, but if it had that of<br>any of the other kinds of blood she is clean. But is this correct? Surely when R. Hoshaia arrived from<br>Nehardea he came [to the schoolhouse] and brought with him a Baraitha: If a woman aborted a<br>shapeless object that was red, black, green or white, if there was blood with it, she is unclean,<br>otherwise she is clean; but R. Judah ruled: In either case she is unclean. Now here red, black, green<br>and white were mentioned and R. Judah nevertheless disagrees.<sup>5</sup> And should you reply that R. Judah<br>differs only in respect of red and black but not in that of green and white [the question would arise]:<br>For<sup>6</sup> whose benefit then was green and white mentioned? If it be suggested: For that of the Rabbis [it<br>could be retorted]: Since the Rabbis declared the woman clean even in the case of red and black<br>blood, was it any longer necessary to state that the same law applies also to green and white? Must it<br>not then be conceded that these were mentioned for the benefit of R. Judah who,<sup>7</sup> it thus follows,<br>does differ?<sup>8</sup> — Rather, said R. Johanan,<sup>9</sup> the point at issue between them is the question whether it<br>is possible for the uterus to open without bleeding.<sup>5</sup> They thus differ on the same principle as that on<br>which the following Tannas differ. For it was taught: If a woman was in hard labour for two days<br>and on the third she aborted and she does not know what she had aborted, her case is one of doubtful<br>childbirth and doubtful zibah, and she must, therefore, bring a sacrifice which may not be eaten. R.<br>Joshua ruled: She must bring a sacrifice, and it may be eaten, since it is impossible for the uterus to<br>open without some bleeding.<sup>5</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: If a woman aborted a shapeless object. Symmachus ruled in the name of R.<br>Meir, and R. Simeon b. Menasia likewise gave the same ruling: It must be split, and if there was<br>blood in it the woman is unclean and if there is none in it she is clean. This is in agreement with the<br>Rabbis but also more restrictive than the ruling of the Rabbis. It is ‘in agreement with the Rabbis’<br>who ruled that it was possible for the uterus to open without bleeding; but it is ‘also more restrictive<br>than the ruling of the Rabbis’, since they hold that only where the blood was with it<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> is the woman<br>unclean<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> but not where it was only within it,<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> while Symmachus holds that [the woman is unclean]<br>even if the blood was only within it.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> Another [Baraitha] taught: If a woman aborted a shapeless<br>object. R. Aha ruled: It must be split, and if its interior shows red,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> the woman is unclean, otherwise<br>she is clean. This is in agreement with Symmachus,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> but also more restrictive than the ruling of<br>Symmachus.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> Again another [Baraitha] taught: If a woman aborted a shapeless object, R. Benjamin<br>ruled: It must be split, and if there was a bone in it, its mother is unclean by reason of childbirth.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> R.<br>Hisda explained: This applies only to a white object.<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> So also when a pair [of scholars]<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> from<br>Adiabene arrived they came [into the schoolhouse] and brought with them the following Baraitha: If<br>a woman aborted a white shapeless object it must be split and if there was a bone in it the mother is<br>unclean by reason of childbirth.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup><br>R. Johanan citing R. Simeon b. Yohai ruled: If a woman aborted a shapeless object it must be<br>split, and if it contained a quantity of accumulated blood she is unclean, otherwise<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> she is clean.<br>This is in agreement with Symmachus<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> but is also the most lenient of all the previous rulings.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup><br>R. Jeremiah enquired of R. Zera: What is the ruling where a woman observed a discharge of blood<br>in a tube?<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> Since the All Merciful has said, In her flesh<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> He implied: But not in a tube,<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> or is it<br>possible that the text, ‘In her flesh’, was required for the deduction that it<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> causes uncleanness<br>within<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> as well as without?<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> — The other replied: The All Merciful said, In her flesh<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> implying:<br>But not in a tube; for if the expression ‘In her flesh’ had been required for the deduction that it<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup><br>causes uncleanness within as well as without, Scripture should have said, Her flesh,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> why then did it<br>say, ‘In her flesh’? Both rulings may, therefore, be deduced. But did not R. Johanan rule in the name<br>of R. Simeon b. Yohai: If a woman aborted a shapeless object it must be split, and if there was in it a<br>quantity of accumulated blood she is unclean, otherwise she is clean?<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> — What a comparison!<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> In<br>that case it is usual for a woman to observe blood in a shapeless abortion,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> but in this case it is not<br>usual for a woman to observe blood in a tube.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup><br>May it be suggested that the question of blood in a tube is a point at issue between Tannas? For it<br>was taught: If a woman aborted a shapeless object, even though it is full of blood, it is only where<br>there was a discharge of blood with it<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> that the woman is unclean; otherwise she is clean. R. Eliezer<br>ruled: ‘In her flesh’<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> implies: But not [where the blood was] within a sac or within any shapeless<br>abortion. (Is not R. Eliezer's ruling identical with that of the first Tanna?<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> — Read: For R. Eliezer<br>ruled, ‘In her flesh’ implies: But not [where the blood was] within a sac or within any shapeless<br>abortion). But the Sages ruled: This is not menstrual blood but the blood of a shapeless object.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup><br>Now does not the first Tanna also declare her clean?<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> But the fact is that the difference between<br>them is the case where the abortion was chapped. The first Tanna is of the opinion that ‘In her flesh’<br>implies: But not [where the blood was] in a sac or in a shapeless object,<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> and the same applies also<br>to a tube.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> This, however, holds good only where it<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> was smooth,<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> but if it was chapped<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> the<br>woman is unclean. What is his reason? It may be described as ‘In her flesh’.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> Thereupon the Rabbis<br>came to declare: Although it<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> was chapped [the woman is clean since] the discharge is not<br>menstrual but that of the shapeless object.<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> Menstrual blood, however, is undoubtedly a cause of<br>uncleanness<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> even if it was in a tube!<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> — Abaye replied: As regards a tube all<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> agree that the<br>woman is clean,<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup><br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Since it is not known whether (a) the abortion was an embryo in consequence of which, whether there was bleeding<br>or not, she is to bring the sacrifice prescribed for a woman in childbirth; or (b) a mere lump of flesh, in which case, if<br>there was no bleeding, no such sacrifice is due; or (c) there was a discharge of blood with (b) in which case (being that<br>of a discharge on three consecutive days) she must bring the sacrifice prescribed for zibah.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) To provide (cf. prev. n.) against the possibility of (a) or (c).<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Since it is possible, as explained in note <sup>3</sup>(b). that she is neither in the position of one in childbirth nor in that of one<br>in zibah, in consequence of which she is not liable to either sacrifice, and the bird that she brought as a sin-offering,<br>having had its head pinched off in accordance with the ritual prescribed for such a sacrifice, is (owing to the possibility<br>that it is no sacrifice at all and that it is, therefore, subject to the rules of slaughter appertaining to unconsecrated<br>animals) thus forbidden to be eaten as the flesh of nebelah.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) So that a sacrifice is due in either case: If she gave birth to an embryo she has to bring the sacrifice prescribed for one<br>in childbirth, and if she merely aborted a lump of flesh, since this was inevitably accompanied by bleeding, she (cf. supra<br>n. <sup>4</sup>) is regarded as a zabah and is liable to bring the one prescribed for zibah.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Cf. notes on prev. version.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Cf. Bah.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Since he ruled, ‘In either case she is unclean’.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) From the Rabbis who declared the woman clean.

Her<br>period of uncleanness extends over fourteen days (prescribed for the birth of a female, and not seven as for a male) while<br>her period of cleanness terminates on the fortieth day (prescribed for a male and not on the eightieth prescribed for a<br>female).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Which is regarded as a kind of flesh.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Zuga.

Now if the blood in the abortion causes uncleanness why should not also blood in a tube?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) Lit., ‘thus, now’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) It comes, therefore, under the description ‘in her flesh’; hence the woman's uncleanness.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) Hence R. Zera's ruling that the woman is clean.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) When it passed out.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) Obviously it is. Why then should R.

What then is the difference between their respective views?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) Since in these cases there is an interposition between the woman's body (‘her flesh’) and the blood.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) The abortion.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) So that all the blood within it is completely separated from the woman's body.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) In consequence of which some of the blood and the woman's body come in direct contact.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) It being a Pentateuchal ordinance that when the blood was in direct contact with the woman's body uncleanness is<br>caused.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) As it is not menstrual at all it matters little whether it did, or did not come in contact with the body of the woman<br>who, consequently, is in either case regarded as clean.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) Since the discharge came from the uterus.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) It thus follows that R. Zera's view is that of the first Tanna while the Rabbis opposed this view. Is it likely, however,<br>that R. Zera adopted the view of the first Tanna, an individual, when it was opposed by the Rabbis who were in the<br>majority?<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) Even the Rabbis.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) Since the Scriptural text ‘In her flesh’ cannot be applied to it (Rashal).",
        "and they only differ in the case of a shapeless object.<sup>1</sup> One Master<sup>2</sup> holds that it is usual for a woman<br>to observe blood in a shapeless object<sup>3</sup> and the Masters<sup>4</sup> hold that it is not usual for a woman to<br>observe blood in such an object.<sup>5</sup> Raba replied that all<sup>6</sup> agreed that it is not usual for a woman to<br>observe blood in a shapeless object, but it is on the question whether the woman is clean<sup>7</sup> and the<br>interior of the uterus is unclean<sup>8</sup> that they differ, R. Eliezer being of the opinion that though the<br>woman is clean<sup>9</sup> the blood is unclean since it comes through the uterus,<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> while the Rabbis hold the<br>opinion that the woman is clean and the interior of the uterus is also clean.<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup><br>Rabba required of R. Huna: What is the ruling where one observed semen on a splinter?<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> Did the<br>Divine Law say, From him<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> to indicate that the man is unclean only when it<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> issued naturally from<br>his body but not when it was brought out by means of a splinter, or is it possible that the expression<br>‘from him’ implies [that the man is unclean] only when his uncleanness<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> has come out of his body,<br>in which case [he is unclean] even though that was effected by means of a splinter? — The other<br>replied: You can infer the ruling [from the fact] that the man himself<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> becomes unclean only when<br>the quantity of semen emitted suffices to close up the orifice of the membrum.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> This then<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> implies<br>that the man<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> is regarded as having touched the semen.<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> But, then, this<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> should not cause [the<br>counting of the clean days] after a zibah to be void.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> Why then was it taught: This is the law of him<br>that hath an issue,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> and of him from whom the flow of seed<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> goeth out,<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> as zibah<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> causes [the<br>counting of the clean days] to be void<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> so does semen? — The other replied: As regards counting<br>again, this is the reason why the previous counting is void: because it is impossible for semen to be<br>emitted<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> without an admixture of some particles of zibah.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> Now then,<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> this should cause the<br>counting of all the seven days<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> to be void,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> why then was it taught: ‘ This is the law of him that<br>hath an issue etc.’, as zibah causes the clean days to be counted again so does semen? But in case<br>you should assume that as zibah causes the counting of all the seven days<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> to be void so does semen<br>also, it was expressly stated, So that he is unclean thereby;<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> you can apply to it<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> only that which<br>had been said about it,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> hence it causes the counting of one day only to be void?<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> — The other<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup><br>replied: It is a decree of Scripture that an absolute zibah in which no semen is mixed causes the<br>counting of all seven days to be void, but particles of zibah in which semen is mixed cause only the<br>counting of one day<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> to be void.<br>R. Jose son of R. Hanina enquired of R. Eleazar: What is the ruling in the case of dry blood?<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> Did<br>the Divine Law say, Have an issue<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> of her blood<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> to indicate that it must be actually flowing,<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup><br>hence it refers only to fluid blood but not to dry, or is it possible that the expression, ‘have all issue<br>of her blood’<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> was used merely because blood usually flows, but the same law in fact applies to dry<br>blood also? — The other replied: You have learnt it: The blood of a menstruant and the flesh of a<br>corpse convey uncleanness when fresh or when dry.<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> Said he [R. Jose] to him, ‘Where the blood<br>was first fresh and then it dried up, I have no question to ask; my question arises only where it was<br>originally dry’.<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> ‘This also’, the other replied, ‘you have learnt: IF A WOMAN ABORTED AN<br>OBJECT THAT WAS LIKE A RIND, LIKE A HAIR, LIKE EARTH, LIKE RED FLIES, LET HER<br>PUT IT IN WATER<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) That was chapped.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) The first Tanna.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) The woman is, therefore, unclean.

        "AND IF IT DISSOLVES SHE IS UNCLEAN.<sup>1</sup> But if so,<sup>2</sup> [should not uncleanness be caused] even<br>if the object was not dissolved? — Rabbah replied: If it is not dissolved it is an independent<br>creature.<sup>3</sup> But is there such a phenomenon?<sup>4</sup> Yes; and so it was taught: R. Eleazar son of R. Zadok<br>stated, A report of the following two incidents was brought up by my father from Tib'in<sup>5</sup> to Jamnia.<br>It once happened that a woman was aborting objects like pieces of red rind and the people came and<br>asked my father, and my father asked the Sages, and the Sages asked the physicians who explained<br>to them that that woman had an internal sore [the crust] of which she cast out in the shape of the<br>pieces of red rind. [It was ruled that] she should put them in water and if they dissolved she should<br>be declared unclean. And yet another incident occurred when a woman was aborting objects like red<br>hairs, and she came and asked my father, and my father asked the Sages, and the Sages asked the<br>physicians who explained to them that the woman had a wart<sup>6</sup> in her internal organs and that that<br>was the cause of her aborting objects like red hairs.<sup>7</sup><br>LET<sup>8</sup> HER PUT IT IN WATER AND IF IT DISSOLVES SHE IS UNCLEAN. Resh Lakish<br>ruled: And [this must be done] with lukewarm water.<sup>9</sup> So it was also taught: Let her put it in water,<br>viz., in lukewarm water. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel ruled: She [must attempt to] crush it with spittle on<br>her nail. What is the practical difference between them?<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> — Rabina replied: The practical difference<br>between them is [an abortion that can be] crushed by the exercise of pressure.<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup><br>Elsewhere we have learnt: How long must they<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> be soaked in the lukewarm water?<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup><br>Twenty-four hours.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> Now in this case,<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> what length of time is required? Do we require a period of<br>twenty-four hours or not?<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> Is it only in regard to a creeping thing and carrion, which are tough, that<br>a twenty-four hours’ soaking is required but not in that of blood, which is soft, or is it possible that<br>there is no difference? — This is undecided.<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup><br>IF AN ABORTION WAS IN THE SHAPE OF FISHES. But why does not R. Judah<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> disagree<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup><br>in this case also?<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> — Resh Lakish replied: This<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> was indeed learnt as a controversial ruling,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> and<br>it<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> represents only the opinion of the Rabbis. R. Johanan, however, replied: It<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> may even be said to<br>agree with R. Judah,<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> for R. Judah gave his ruling<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> only there, in the case of a SHAPELESS<br>OBJECT, since it is the nature of blood to congeal and to assume the form of a shapeless object,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup><br>but [not here,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> since] it<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> can never assume the form of a creature.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> According, however, to that<br>version in which R.

Judah<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> have disagreed in this<br>case also? — He who learnt that version<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> reads here: Both R. Johanan and Resh Lakish replied:<br>This<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> was learnt as a controversial ruling,<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> and it<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> represents only the view of the Rabbis.<br>IF AN ABORTION HAD THE SHAPE OF A BEAST etc. Rab Judah citing Samuel stated: What<br>is the reason of R.

Since in their case<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> an expression of forming<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> is used as in that of man.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup><br>Now then, if an abortion was in the likeness of a sea-monster<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> would its mother be unclean by<br>reason of child-birth, since an expression of forming was used in its case as in that of man, it having<br>been said, And God created<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> the great sea-monsters?<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> — I can answer: An expression of forming<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup><br>may be deduced from another expression of forming<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> but one of creating<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> may not be deduced<br>from one of forming.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> But where lies the practical difference between the two expressions? Surely<br>the School of R. Ishmael taught: And the priest shall return,<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> and the priest shall come,<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> ‘returning’<br>and ‘coming’ are the same thing!<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> Furthermore, why should not one expression of ‘creating’<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> be<br>deduced from another expression of ‘creating’, it being written, And God created man in His own<br>image?<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> — I can answer: ‘And . . . created’<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> is required for its own context while ‘and . . . formed<br>is available for deduction, hence it is that the expression of ‘forming’<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> may be deducted from the<br>similar one of ‘forming’.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> On the contrary [might it not be submitted that] ‘And... formed’<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> was<br>required for its own context while ‘and . . . created’<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> is available for deduction, hence the<br>expression of ‘creating’<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> may be deduced from ‘creating’?<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> — The fact is that the expression ‘And<br>. . . formed’ is available for deduction on the two sides: It is available in the case of man<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> and it is<br>also available in that of beast;<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> but the expression of ‘And . . . created’ is available for deduction<br>only in the case of man<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> but it is not available for the purpose in that of sea-monsters.<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> But why is<br>it<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> regarded available for deduction in the case of beast? If it be suggested because it is written, And<br>God made the beast of the earth<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> and it is also written, And out of the ground the Lord God formed<br>every beast of the field,<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> is not a similar expression [it may be retorted] also available for deduction<br>in the case of a sea-monster, since it is written, And God made . . . and every thing that creepeth<br>upon the ground,<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> and it is also written, And God created the great seamonsters?<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> — ‘Every thing<br>that creepeth’ that was written in the previously mentioned verse refers to those on the dry land.<br>What, however, is the practical difference between an expression that is available for deduction on<br>one side and one that is available for deduction on two sides?<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> — The practical difference is the<br>statement Rab Judah made in the name of Samuel who had it from R. Ishmael:<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> From any gezerah<br>shawah<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> neither of whose terms is available for deduction<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> no deduction may be made;<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> if one of<br>the terms is available for the purpose, then according to R. Ishmael, a deduction may be made and no<br>refutation may be offered, while according to the Rabbis deduction may be made<sup>6</sup><sup>4</sup> but a refutation<sup>6</sup><sup>5</sup><br>may be offered; and if both terms are available for deduction, all<sup>6</sup><sup>6</sup> agree that deduction may be made<br>and no refutation may be offered. As to R. Ishmael,however, what is the practical difference between<br>a gezerah shawah one of whose terms only is available for deduction and one both of whose terms<br>are available for the purpose? — The practical difference is that where there is one of which one<br>term only is available for deduction and another both of which both terms are available for deduction<br>we must leave the former<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Because it is regarded as unclean blood though when she first observed the object it was as dry, for instance, as earth.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) That dry blood also causes uncleanness.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) And cannot be regarded as congealed blood.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) An abortion LIKE A RIND OR LIKE A HAIR.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) In Galilee west of Sepphoris.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) From which grew hairs.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Tosef. Nid. IV.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Cf. Bomb. ed. Cur. edd. do not indicate that this is a quotation from our Mishnah.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Resistance to which is proof that it is no mass of congealed blood. Resistance to cold water alone is no proof that it is<br>not congealed blood, since it is possible that it would dissolve in lukewarm water and the woman, therefore, cannot be<br>declared clean.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) R. Simeon b. Gamaliel and the first Tanna.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) But cannot be dissolved by mere immersion in lukewarm water. According to the first Tanna, since lukewarm water<br>cannot dissolve it, it cannot be regarded as blood, while according to R. Simeon b. Gamaliel, since it may be squashed by<br>pressure, it must be regarded as blood.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Unclean things such, for instance, as a dead creeping thing and carrion which have become dry.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) To restore them to their original condition of freshness. These (as stated infra) convey uncleanness only when fresh<br>but not when dry.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Infra <sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup>b.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) RIND, HAIR, EARTH etc. spoken of in our Mishnah.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Sc. even a lesser period suffices to establish that they are masses of congealed blood.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Teku.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Who in an earlier clause of our Mishnah ruled, IN EITHER CASE SHE IS UNCLEAN.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) With the ruling that, OTHERWISE SHE IS CLEAN.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Sc. why does he not here also maintain that the woman is unclean in either case?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) The anonymous ruling under discussion.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) R. Judah and the Rabbis being in disagreement on it.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) The anonymous ruling under discussion.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Who in this case is of the same opinion as the Rabbis.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) That IN EITHER CASE SHE IS UNCLEAN.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Hence his ruling (cf. prev. n.) whenever the object had the colour of one of the four kinds of unclean blood. His<br>ruling is thus entirely independent of the question whether the uterus does or does not open without bleeding.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) In the case of an abortion of FISHES, LOCUSTS etc.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) Blood.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) And since the abortion under discussion did assume the form of a creature, R. Judah agrees with the Rabbis that<br>OTHERWISE SHE IS CLEAN.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) Supra <sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>b.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Since the character of the abortion itself is of no consequence.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) The one just referred to.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) The anonymous ruling under discussion.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) R. Judah and the Rabbis being in disagreement on it.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) Beasts and birds.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) And . . . the Lord God formed every beast . . . and every fowl (Gen.

        "and make the deduction from the latter. And it is for this reason<sup>1</sup> that in the case of beast the All<br>Merciful made both terms available for deduction: In order that no deduction shall be made from one<br>of which one term only is available for deduction.<sup>2</sup><br>R. Aha son of Raba taught this<sup>3</sup> in the name of R. Eleazar in the direction of leniency. From any<br>gezerah shawah none of whose terms is available for deduction, one may make the deduction and<br>one may also offer a refutation; if one of its terms only is available for the purpose, deduction,<br>according to R. Ishmael, may be made and no refutation may be offered, while according to the<br>Rabbis deduction may be made and a refutation may be offered; and if two of its terms are available<br>for deduction, all agree that deduction may be made and no refutation may be offered. But according<br>to the Rabbis<sup>4</sup> what is the practical difference between one whose one term is available for deduction<br>and one none of whose terms is available for deduction? — The practical difference between them is<br>the case where you find a gezerah shawah one of whose terms is available for deduction and another<br>none of whose terms is available for the purpose, and neither the one nor the other can be refuted, in<br>such a case we must leave the one neither of whose terms is available and make deduction from the<br>one of which one term is available. But what refutation is there in this case?<sup>5</sup> — One might object:<sup>6</sup><br>A man is different<sup>7</sup> since he contracts uncleanness<sup>8</sup> even when he is alive.<sup>9</sup><br>R. Hiyya b. Abba citing R. Johanan also stated,<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> This is the reason of R. Meir: Since the<br>expression of ‘forming’ has been used in its case as in that of man. Said R. Ammi to him: Now then,<br>If an abortion was in the shape of a mountain would the woman who aborted it<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> be unclean by<br>reason of the birth because it is said, For, lo, He that formeth<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> the mountains and createth the<br>wind?<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> — The other replied: Does she ever abort a mountain? She can only abort something in the<br>shape of a stone, and that can only be described as a lump.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> But then, if the abortion was some<br>inflated object would the woman who aborted it<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> be unclean by reason of the birth because the<br>expression of ‘creating’ has been used about it as about man, since it is written, And createth<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> the<br>wind?<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> And should you reply: it<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> is not available for deduction,<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> [it could be retorted:] Since it<br>could have been written, ‘Formeth the mountains and the wind’, and yet it was written ‘And createth<br>the wind’ it may be inferred, may it not, that it<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> was intended to be made available for deduction?<br>— The other replied: An analogy for legal purposes may be drawn between words that occur in the<br>Pentateuch<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> but no analogy may be drawn between words that occur respectively in the Pentateuch<br>and in the post-Pentateuchal books.<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup><br>Rabbah<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> b. Bar Hana citing R. Johanan stated, This is the reason of R. Meir: Because [the<br>pupils<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> of] their<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> eyes are similar to those of human beings. Now then, if an abortion was in the<br>likeness of a serpent would the woman who aborted it<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> be unclean on account of the birth since its<br>eye-ball is round like that of a human eye? And should you suggest that the law is so indeed [it could<br>be retorted]: Why then was not the serpent mentioned?<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> — If the serpent had been mentioned<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> it<br>might have been presumed that only in the case of the serpent do the Rabbis disagree with R. Meir,<br>since the expression of ‘forming’ was not written about it but that in the case of a beast or a wild<br>animal they do not differ from him since the expression of ‘forming’ had been written about it.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> But<br>was it not stated in regard to blemishes,<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> ‘One whose eyeball is like that of a man’?<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> — This is no<br>difficulty, the one<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> refers to the black of the eye<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> while the other refers to the slit.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup><br>R. Jannai stated, This is the reason of R. Meir: Because their<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> eyes are fixed in the front of their<br>heads<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> like those of men. But what about<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> a bird whose eyes are not fixed in the front of its head<br>and R. Meir nevertheless ruled that it is a cause of uncleanness? — Abaye replied: This<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> applies<br>only to the kadia<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> and the kipufa.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> It<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> does not then apply to other birds! An objection was raised:<br>R. Hanina b. Gamaliel<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> stated, I approve of the view of R. Meir in regard to beasts and wild animals<br>and that of the Sages in regard to birds. Now what did he mean by ‘birds’? If it be suggested: kadia<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup><br>and kipufa<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> [the difficulty would arise]: Wherein do beasts and wild animals differ [from other<br>creatures]? [Obviously in that] that their eyes are fixed in front of their heads like those of men. Now<br>are not those of the kadia<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> and the kipufa<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> fixed in the same position?<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> Consequently<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> he must<br>have meant other birds. Thus it may be implied, may it not, that R. Meir differs from the Rabbis in<br>regard to the other birds?<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> — Some part is missing<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> and this is the correct reading: R. Hanina b.<br>Gamaliel<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> stated, I approve of the view of R. Meir in regard to beasts and wild animals, this<br>applying also to the kadia and the kipufa; and that of the Sages in regard to other birds; for even R.<br>Meir disagreed with them only in regard to the kadia and the kipufa, but in the case of other birds he<br>agrees with them. And so it was also taught: R. Eliezer son of R. Zadok stated: An abortion that had<br>the shape of a beast or a wild animal is, according to the view of R. Meir, regarded as a valid birth,<br>but according to the view of the Sages it is no valid birth; and in the case of birds an examination<br>should take place. Now according to whose view should an examination take place? Obviously<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup><br>according to that of R. Meir who ruled that the law<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> applied<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> to the kadia and the kipufa and not to<br>the other birds! R. Aha son of R. Ika retorted: No; the examination should take place according to<br>the Rabbis who ruled that kadia and kipufa are regarded as valid births<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> but not other birds. But<br>wherein does the kadia or the kipufa in this respect differ from beasts and wild animals?<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> — In that<br>they have jaws like those of men.<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup><br>R. Jeremiah enquired of R. Zera: According to R. Meir who ruled: ‘A beast that was in a woman's<br>body is a valid birth’, what is the law where its father<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> received for it a token of betrothal?<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> — In<br>what respect could this<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> ever matter? — In respect of causing its sister to be forbidden.<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> This then<br>presumes<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> that it is viable! But did not Rab Judah citing Rab state: R. Meir gave his ruling<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> only<br>because in the case of its own species<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> it is viable?<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> Said R. Aha b. Jacob: ‘To such an extent did<br>R. Jeremiah try<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> to make R. Zera laugh; but the latter did not laugh’.<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup><br>[Reverting to] the [previous] text, ‘Rab Judah citing Rab stated: R. Meir gave his ruling only<br>because in the case of its own species it is viable.’ Said R. Jeremiah of Difti:<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) According to the Rabbis.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Since such a gezerah shawah, as stated supra, could be refuted.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) The statement cited supra by Rab Judah.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Who maintain that whether one, or none of the terms is available for deduction both deduction and refutation are<br>admissible.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) The analogy (supra <sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>b) with man. Sc. since, as was explained supra, the only reason why deduction is made from a<br>gezerah shawah both of whose terms are available for the purpose in preference to one of which one term only is<br>available is the consideration that while the latter can be refuted when a logical refutation is offered the former cannot be<br>refuted even in such a case, it follows that where no refutation can be offered it is immaterial whether the deduction is<br>made from the one or the other. And since R. Meir (supra <sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>b) preferred the gezerah shawah between man and beast<br>(both of whose terms are available) to that of man and sea-monsters (whose one term only is available) he must have<br>intended to avoid thereby a refutation that had suggested itself to him. Now what was that refutation?<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Lit., ‘because there is (an argument) to refute’.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) From other creatures.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) From a dead creeping thing, for instance.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Other creatures, however, while alive can never become unclean. It could, therefore, have been argued that man who<br>is subject to the one restriction of uncleanness may also be a cause of uncleanness to his mother when he is born, but any<br>other creature which is not subject to the former restriction is also exempt from the latter.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Like Rab Judah, supra <sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>b.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Lit., ‘its mother’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) An expression of ‘forming’ like that used of man.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) Amos IV, <sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) To which the term ‘mountain’ cannot apply.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) An expression of ‘creating’ like that used of man.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Cf. prev. n.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) I.e., it is required for its own context.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Torah, in its restrictive connotation.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Kabalah, lit., ‘acceptance’, ‘tradition’ as distinct from Torah. (Cf. prev. n.).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Cur. edd. in parenthesis ‘he said’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) V. Rashi and infra.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Beasts.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) In our Mishnah, among the shapes of creatures that cause the woman's uncleanness.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Hence the omission of the serpent.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) Which disqualify a beast.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Bek. <sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>a. Now since such likeness is regarded as a blemish it is obvious that the normal eye of a beast is different<br>from the human one. How then could R. Johanan maintain that a beast's eyes are like human eyes?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) R. Johanan's statement.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) The pupil, which has the same round shape in man and beasts.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) In which the eye is fixed. This is not so round in the eye of a beast as in the human eye.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) Beasts’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Lit., ‘go before them’. Those of fishes and serpents are fixed in the sides of their heads.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) Lit., ‘and behold’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) R. Meir's ruling just cited.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) Or (as cur. edd.) ‘karia’, a species of owls.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) Also a species of owls.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) Cf. Tosaf. supra <sup>8</sup>b. s.v. tvu. Cur. edd. in parenthesis, ‘Antigonus’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) Of course they are. Consequently they should have been subject to the same law as beasts and wild animals.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) Since he made them subject to a different law.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) If he had not differed, there would have been no point in R. Hanina's statement, ‘I would approve . . . that of the<br>Sages’.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) In R. Hanina's statement.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) Lit., ‘not?’<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) That the birth is regarded as valid.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘yes’.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) Who also have their eyes in the sides of their heads. If according to the Rabbis an abortion of the former causes<br>uncleanness why should not also the latter?<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) Which beasts and wild animals have not.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) Who is entitled to effect the betrothal of his daughter while she is a minor.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup>) Which is a valid kinyan (v. Glos.) in the case of a normal child.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup>) Such an absurd betrothal.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup>) To marry the man who betrothed it. It is forbidden to marry a wife's sister.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>) Since a wife's sister is forbidden to a man only during the lifetime of his wife.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup>) That an abortion of a beast or wild animal is regarded as a valid birth.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup>) Beast born from beast or wild animal from wild animal.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup>) But not when a woman aborted such creatures. The question of wife's sisters, consequently, could never arise in<br>such a case. What then was the point in R. Jeremiah's peculiar enquiry?<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup>) By his absurd enquiries.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup>) It is forbidden to indulge in laughter in this world (cf. Ber. <sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>a).",
        "We also learnt the same thing:<sup>1</sup> An abortion in the shape of a beast, wild animal or bird [is regarded<br>as a valid birth];<sup>2</sup> so R. Meir. And the Sages ruled: [It is no valid birth]<sup>3</sup> unless it has the features of a<br>human being. But if the abortion was a sandal,<sup>4</sup> a placenta or a foetus with some articulated shape, or<br>if a child issued cut up in pieces, the son born after it is regarded as the firstborn in respect of<br>inheritance but he is no firstborn as far as the priest is concerned.<sup>5</sup> Now if one could imagine that<br>such an abortion is viable, would the son born after it be regarded as the firstborn in regard to<br>inheritance?<sup>6</sup> Said Raba: It may well be maintained that it is viable but the case there<sup>7</sup> is different<br>[from what might have been expected]<sup>8</sup> since Scripture said, The first of his mourning<sup>9</sup> which refers<br>to the one for whom<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> his<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> heart aches, and thus excludes an abortion for which<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> his heart does not<br>ache.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup><br>R. Adda b. Ahaba enquired of Abaye: According to R. Meir who ruled that a beast that was in the<br>bowels of a woman is a valid birth, what is the ruling where a human child was in the bowels of a<br>beast?<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> — In what respect does this matter? — In that of permitting it to be eaten.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> But why can<br>you not solve this question from the following ruling of R. Johanan; for R. Johanan ruled: If one<br>slaughtered a beast and found in it an object of the shape of a dove it<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> is forbidden to be eaten?<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> —<br>What a comparison! In that case<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> there are neither cloven feet nor hoofs, but in this case, granted<br>that there are no cloven feet, there is at least some thing like a hoof.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup><br>THE SAGES, HOWEVER, RULED: ANYTHING THAT HAS NOT etc. R. Jeremiah b. Abba<br>citing Rab stated: All<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> agree that if its body was that of a he-goat and its face that of a human being<br>it is regarded as a human child;<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> if its body was that of a human being and its face that of a he-goat<br>it is no valid birth.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> They<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> differ only where it had the face of a human being but was so created<br>that one of its eyes was like that of a beast, since R. Meir holds that it<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> need only have some of the<br>features of a human face<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> while the Sages hold that it<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> must have all the features of a human face.<br>They<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> said to R. Jeremiah b. Abba, Was not the reverse taught: R.

Jeremiah b. Abba citing R.

And if you prefer I might say: It<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> is in fact in agreement with him<br>who stated that the reading<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> was it need only have one of the features of a human face’ but<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> the<br>meaning<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> of ‘one’<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> is one of each.<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup><br>Raba ruled: If a foetus was created with one eye and one thigh, the woman who gives birth to it<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup><br>is unclean<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> if these were on the side,<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> but if they were in the middle<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> she is clean.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> Raba further<br>ruled: If a child's gullet is perforated<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> his mother is unclean,<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> but if his gullet is closed up<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> she is<br>clean.<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: If a woman aborted a stumped body she is not unclean by reason of such a<br>birth.

The point at issue between R. Zakkai and R.

Jannai and R. Johanan<sup>8</sup> is a ruling<br>of R. Eleazar; for R. Eleazar ruled: If the haunch and its hollow were removed the animal is<br>nebelah.<sup>9</sup> R. Papa stated: The dispute<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> refers only to cases where the lower part of the body is<br>affected<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> but if the upper part is affected,<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> even if the missing part is ever so small the woman is<br>clean.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> So also said R. Giddal in the name of R. Johanan: If a woman aborted a foetus whose skull<br>is a shapeless lump she<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> is clean.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> R. Giddal citing R. Johanan further stated: If a woman aborted a<br>foetus shaped like the ramification of a palmtree<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> she is clean.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup><br>It was stated: If a woman aborted a foetus whose face was mashed,<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> R. Johanan ruled: She<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> is<br>unclean; and Resh Lakish ruled: She is clean. R. Johanan raised an objection against Resh Lakish: If<br>a woman aborted a shaped<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> hand or a shaped foot she<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> is subject to the uncleanness of birth<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> and<br>there is no need to consider the possibility<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> that it might have come from a shapeless body.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> Now if<br>it were so,<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> should it not have been stated, ‘The possibility that it might have come from a shapeless<br>body or from a foetus whose face was mashed’?<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup><br>R. Papi stated:<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> Where its<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> face was mashed no one<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> disputes the ruling that the woman is<br>unclean. They only differ where its face was entirely covered over,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> and the statement<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> was made<br>in the reverse order: R. Johanan ruled: His mother is clean; and Resh Lakish ruled: His mother is<br>unclean. Should not then<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> Resh Lakish raise an objection against R. Johanan from that [Baraitha]?<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup><br>— Because the latter could have answered him: ‘A stumped body’ and ‘a foetus whose face was<br>entirely covered over are identical terms.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup><br>The sons of R. Hiyya once toured the countryside. When they appeared before their father he<br>asked them, ‘Has any case been submitted for your consideration?’ ‘The case of a foetus whose face<br>was entirely covered over’, they told him ‘has been submitted to us, and we decided that the woman<br>was unclean’. ‘Go back’, he said to them, ‘and declare as clean that which you have declared<br>unclean. For what did you think?<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> That you are restricting the law;<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> but this is a restriction that<br>results in a relaxation, for thereby<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> you also allow her<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> the days of cleanness’.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup><br>It was stated: If one aborted a creature that had two backs and two spinal columns, Rab ruled: In<br>the case of a woman it is no valid birth<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> and in that of a beast it is forbidden to be eaten;<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> but<br>Samuel ruled: In the case of a woman it is a valid birth<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> and in that of a beast it is permitted to be<br>eaten.<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> On what principle do they<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> differ? — On that of R. Hanin b. Abba; for R. Hanin b. Abba<br>stated, ‘The cloven’<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> is a creature that has two backs and two spinal columns’.<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> Rab maintains that<br>such a creature exists nowhere in the world, and that when the All Merciful taught Moses about it<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup><br>he must have taught him about one that was still in her dam's bowels, while Samuel maintains that<br>such a creature does exist in the world so that when the All Merciful taught Moses about it<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> he<br>taught him about the species in general,<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> but one that is still in its dam's bowels is well permitted to<br>be eaten.<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> R. Shimi b. Hiyya pointed out an objection to Rab: R. Hanina b. Antigonus stated, Any<br>[firstling of beasts] that had two backs and two spinal columns is unfit for the Temple service;<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup><br>from which<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> it is obvious, is it not, that it is viable?<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> — ‘Is it you, Shimi?’ the other<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> replied,<br>‘this<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> refers to a case where its spinal column was only crooked’.<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup><br>An objection was raised: Among embryos<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> there are some that are forbidden<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> viz, a four<br>monthly embryo among small cattle, and an eight monthly one among large cattle, and one that is<br>younger<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> is equally forbidden. From this is excluded one that had two backs and two spinal<br>columns. Now what is meant by ‘is excluded’? Obviously that it<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> is excluded from the category of<br>embryos<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> in that it is forbidden to be eaten even while still in its dam's body?<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> — Rab<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> explains in<br>accordance with his own view, and Samuel<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> explains it in accordance with his view. ‘Rab explains<br>in accordance with his own view’, thus: A four monthly embryo among small cattle and an eighth<br>monthly one among large cattle, and one that is younger is equally forbidden. This applies only<br>where it saw the light<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> but while it is still in its dam's bowels it is permitted; but from this is<br>excluded one that has two backs and two spinal columns which, even while still in its dam's bowels,<br>is also forbidden.<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Inclusive; form the foot upwards.

This could not be given as a reply in the<br>case of a mashed face where some of the features are not altogether indistinguishable.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) When declaring the woman unclean.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) Since it was unknown whether the foetus was male or female the woman, having been declared unclean, would<br>have to remain in her uncleanness for a period of fourteen days (as for a female) and not only for seven days (as for a<br>male).<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) By regarding the abortion as a valid birth.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) As a woman after childbirth.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) Which even in the case of a male, are no less than thirty-three. Any discharge of blood within this period would<br>consequently be regarded as clean, whereas if the abortion had not been declared to be a valid birth the discharge would<br>have imposed upon the woman the uncleanness of a menstruant.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) And she remains, therefore, clean.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) Even if it was found in the ritually slaughtered body of its dam, and much more so if it was aborted.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) And the woman is consequently subject to the laws of uncleanness prescribed for one after childbirth.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) As deduced from Scripture in Hul. <sup>6</sup><sup>9</sup>b.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) Rab and Samuel.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) Ha-Shesu'ah, Deut.

The permissibility to eat the creature, even<br>after it was born, thus raises an objection against both Rab (who ruled that it was always forbidden) and against Samuel<br>(who permitted it only when it was in its dam's bowels). V. Marginal Gloss. Cur. edd. in parenthesis add ‘and this is a<br>difficulty against Rab’.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup>) Rab, who was his grandfather.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>) R.

As the first clause deals with those who saw the light the last one<br>(double-backed creatures) also deals obviously with one who saw the light. But its permissibility would be contrary to<br>the ruling of Rab.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup>) Who has to explain the objection raised against him (cf. prev. n. but one).<br>(<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup>) Lit., ‘went out to the air of the world’.",
        "Samuel also ‘explains it in accordance with his view’, thus: A four monthly embryo among small<br>cattle, and an eight monthly one among large cattle, and one that is younger is equally forbidden.<br>This, however, applies only to one whose period of pregnancy<sup>1</sup> had not ended, but if the period has<br>ended it is permitted; and from this is excluded one who had two backs and two spinal columns<br>which, even though its period of pregnancy had ended,it is forbidden if it saw the light<sup>2</sup> but<br>permitted when still in its dam's body.<sup>3</sup><br>A Tanna recited before Rab: As it might have been assumed that if an abortion was a creature with<br>a shapeless body or with a shapeless head its mother is unclean by reason of its birth, it was<br>explicitly stated in Scripture, If a woman be delivered, and bear a man-child etc.<sup>4</sup> And in the eighth<br>day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised etc.,<sup>5</sup> thus implying<sup>6</sup> that only a child that is fit for<br>the covenant of the eight days<sup>7</sup> [causes uncleanness to his mother] but these<sup>8</sup> are excluded, since they<br>are not fit for the covenant of the eight days. ‘And’, said Rab to him, ‘conclude your statement thus:<sup>9</sup><br>And one who had two backs and two spinal columns’.<br>R. Jeremiah b. Abba intended to give a practical decision<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> in agreement with the view of<br>Samuel,<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> but R. Huna said to him: ‘What have you in your mind? To impose a restriction?<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> But<br>this is a restriction that results in a relaxation, since you must in consequence<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> allow her also a<br>period of clean blood.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> Act rather in accordance with the view of Rab, since we have an established<br>rule that in ritual matters the law is in agreement with Rab irrespective of whether this leads to a<br>relaxation or a restriction.<br>Raba said: It has been stated that a woman may bear<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> at nine months<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> and also at seven<br>months.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> Can [then] large cattle who bear<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> at nine months also bear<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> at seven months or not? —<br>R. Nahman b. Isaac replied, Come and hear: ‘One that is younger is equally forbidden’.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> Does not<br>this also refer to the large cattle?<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> — No, it may only refer to the small cattle.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> What an argument<br>this is! If you grant that the reference<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> was to the large cattle also, one can well see the necessity for<br>it. For it might have been presumed that since [a seven monthly] is viable in the case of a woman it is<br>also viable in that of cattle, we were informed that it is not viable; but if you maintain that reference<br>was made to small cattle only, this would be obvious, for can a three monthly abortion live?<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> — It<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup><br>was necessary: As it might have been presumed that anyone [born within] less than two months<br>[before the conclusion of the normal conception] can survive,<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> hence we were informed that it<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup><br>was not viable.<br>Rab Judah citing Samuel ruled: If an abortion had the likeness of Lilith<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> its mother is unclean by<br>reason of the birth, for it is a child, but it has wings. So it was also taught: R. Jose stated, It once<br>happened at Simoni<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> that a woman aborted the likeness of Lilith, and when the case came up for a<br>decision before the Sages they ruled that it was a child but that it also had wings. If an abortion had<br>the likeness of a serpent, Hanina the son of R. Joshua's brother ruled: Its mother is unclean by reason<br>of the birth. R. Joseph proceeded to report the ruling to R. Gamaliel when the latter sent word [to]<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup><br>R. Joshua, ‘Take charge of<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> your nephew and come with him to me’. As they were going,<br>Hanina's<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> daughterin-law came out to meet R. Joshua.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> ‘Master’, she said to him, ‘what is your<br>ruling where an abortion had the likeness of a serpent?’ ‘Its mother’, he replied, ‘is clean’. ‘But’, she<br>retorted, ‘was it not in your name that my mother-in-law told me that its mother was unclean?’<br>‘And’, he asked her, ‘on what ground?’ ‘Since [she told him] its eye-ball is round like that of a<br>human being’. As a result of her statements R. Joshua recollected his ruling and sent the following<br>message to R. Gamaliel: ‘Hanina gave his ruling on my authority’.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> Abaye observed: From this<br>incident it may be learnt that when a scholar gives a ruling he should also indicate his reason so that<br>when he is ever reminded of it he would recollect it.<br><b>MISHNAH</b>.

        "Pushtabna<sup>1</sup> of Pumbeditha reached to<sup>2</sup> half the height of the waiter Adda, while everybody else<br>reached only to the loins of Pushtabna of Pumbeditha.<br>A question was raised in the presence of Rabbi: What is the ruling where a woman aborted a sac<br>full of flesh? ‘I did not hear of such a law’, he answered them. ‘Thus’, announced R. Ishmael son of<br>R. Jose before him, ‘said my father: If it was full of blood the woman is unclean as a menstruant, but<br>if it was full of flesh she is unclean as a woman after childbirth’. The other said to him: Had you told<br>us something new in the name of your father we would have listened to you; but now, since his first<br>ruling<sup>3</sup> was given in accordance with the view of an individual, viz., in agreement with Symmachus<br>who cited R. Meir,<sup>4</sup> his second ruling also<sup>5</sup> might be one given in accordance with the view of R.<br>Joshua;<sup>6</sup> but the halachah is not in agreement with R. Joshua. For it was taught: If an abortion was a<br>sac with no fashioned limbs, R. Joshua ruled: It<sup>7</sup> is regarded as a valid birth<sup>8</sup> but the Sages ruled, it is<br>no valid birth.<sup>9</sup><br>R. Simeon b. Lakish citing R. Oshaia stated: The dispute<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> refers only to a sac that was turbid<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup><br>but if it was clear<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> all agree that it is no valid birth. R. Joshua b. Levi, however, stated: The<br>dispute<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> refers to the case of a clear sac. The question was raised:<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> Do they differ only in the case<br>of a clear sac but in that of a turbid one all agree that it is a valid birth or is it possible that they differ<br>about the one as well as about the other? — This stands undecided.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> An objection was raised: This<br>exposition was made by R. Joshua b. Hananiah: And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife<br>garments of skins, and clothed them<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, makes no skin for<br>man before<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> he is formed. Thus it is clearly proved that a valid birth<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> depends on the skin<br>irrespective of whether the sac was turbid or clear. Now if you grant<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> that the dispute<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> refers to the<br>case of a clear sac there is full justification for his<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> need for a Scriptural text;<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> but if you maintain<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup><br>that the dispute refers only to a turbid sac,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> what need was there for a Scriptural text seeing that the<br>reason<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> is a matter of logic? Consequently it may be inferred that the dispute refers also to a clear<br>sac.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> This is conclusive.<br>R. Nahman citing Rabbah b. Abbuha also<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> stated: They<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> differ only in regard to a turbid sac but<br>as regards a clear one all agree that it is no valid birth. Raba raised an objection against R. Nahman:<br>But they ruled: The token of a valid birth<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> in small cattle is a discharge from the womb,<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> in large<br>cattle the placenta,<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> and in a woman the sac or placenta’,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> but,it follows, the abortion of a sac in<br>cattle provides no exemption.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> Now, if you grant that they<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> differ in the case of a clear sac, one can<br>well see the reason why only a woman whose case Scripture specifically included,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> was granted<br>exemption in respect of a sac<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> while cattle whose case Scripture did not include no exemption was<br>granted in respect of a sac, but if you maintain that the dispute concerns only a turbid sac consider!<br>[The question of the validity of the birth being dependent] on a logical reason<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> what difference in<br>this respect could there be between a woman and cattle?<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> — You think that R. Joshua was quite<br>certain [of the nature of the sac],<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> but the fact is that R. Joshua was rather doubtful on the matter<br>and, therefore, he followed a restrictive course in both cases.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> [Only the question of the firstborn<br>son] of<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> a woman, which is a mere monetary matter,<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> [did he rule that the abortion of a sac<br>constitutes a valid birth,<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> because] in a case of doubt in monetary matters a lenient course<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> is<br>followed.<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> On the question of the firstling of cattle, however, which involves a ritual prohibition of<br>shearing<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> and of work<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> [he ruled the abortion of a sac to be an invalid birth,<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> because] in case of<br>doubt in a ritual prohibition a restrictive course must be followed; and so also [on the question of the<br>uncleanness] of a woman [the abortion of a sac is deemed to be a valid birth,<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> because] in a case of<br>doubtful uncleanness<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> a restrictive course must be followed. But was he<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> in doubt?<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> Did he not, in<br>fact, quote a Scriptural text?<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> — The ruling is only Rabbinical<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> and the Scriptural text is a mere<br>prop.<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup><br>Said R. Hanina b. Shelemya to Rab: We have<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> the statements of<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> Rabbi,<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> of<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> R. Ishmael son of<br>R. Jose,<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> of R. Oshaia<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> and of R. Joshua b. Levi;<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> with whose view does the Master agree? — I<br>maintain, the other replied, that in neither case<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> need she take into consideration the possibility of a<br>valid birth. Samuel, however, ruled: In either case<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> must she consider the possibility of a valid<br>birth.<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> Samuel in this ruling follows his previously expressed view. For R. Dimi when he came<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup><br>stated: Never at Nehardea<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> did they declare [one who aborted] a sac<sup>6</sup><sup>4</sup> to be clean<sup>6</sup><sup>5</sup> except in the<br>case of a certain sac that was submitted to Samuel on which a hair that lay on one side could be seen<br>through the other side when he said: If it were in fact an embryo it would not have been so<br>transparent.<br>BUT IF ITS LIMBS WERE FASHIONED etc. Our Rabbis taught: What is meant by a sac the<br>limbs of which are fashioned? Abba Saul explained: A foetus which in its primary stage resembles a<br>locust,<sup>6</sup><sup>6</sup> and its two eyes are like two drippings<sup>6</sup><sup>7</sup> of a fly. R. Hiyya taught: They are far removed<br>from one another. Its two nostrils are like two drippings of a fly. R. Hiyya taught: They are near one<br>to another. Its mouth is as narrow as a stretched hair,<sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup> its membrum<sup>6</sup><sup>9</sup> is of the size of a lentil<sup>7</sup><sup>0</sup> and<br>in the case of a female [the organ] has the appearance of the longitudinal [slit]<sup>7</sup><sup>1</sup> of a barley grain;<br>but it has no shaped hands or feet.<sup>7</sup><sup>2</sup> Of such a foetus there is this description in the<br>post-Pentateuchal Scriptures:<sup>7</sup><sup>3</sup> Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?<br>Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews.

        "and disturbs its shape. It must rather be examined in oil because oil is mild and makes it clear.<br>Furthermore, it must be examined in sunlight only. How is it to be examined? ‘How is it to be<br>examined’ [you ask]! Of course as has just been described. — Rather, wherewith is it to be examined<br>in order to ascertain whether it was male or female? — Abba Saul b. Nashor, as others say, Abba<br>Saul b. Ramash replied: One brings a splinter with a smooth top and moves it [in an upward<br>direction] in that place.<sup>1</sup> If it is caught it will be known that the foetus is a male,<sup>2</sup> and if not it will be<br>known to be a female. R. Nahman citing Rabbah b.

R. Adda b. Ahaba stated: A Tanna<br>taught, If the foetus was a female the organ has the appearance of the [longitudinal] slit of a barley<br>grain.<sup>4</sup> R.

Amram explained: Like those of the woof;<sup>9</sup> ‘and its two arms are like two threads of<br>silk’, in connection with which R. Amram explained: Like those of the warp.<sup>9</sup><br>Samuel said to Rab Judah: Shinena,<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> give no practical decision [on the validity of a birth] unless<br>the embryo has hair [on its head]. But could Samuel have said such a thing, seeing that he ruled, ‘In<br>either case must she consider the possibility of a valid birth’? — R. Ammi b. Samuel replied: This<br>was explained to me by the Master Samuel: She must indeed take into consideration the possibility<br>of a valid birth;<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> but she is not allowed the privilege of the clean days<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> unless the embryo had hair<br>[on its head]. This then implies that Samuel was doubtful on the point.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> But is it not a fact that when<br>a certain sac was submitted to the Master Samuel he said, ‘This is forty-one days old’, but on<br>calculating the time since the woman had gone to perform her ritual immersion<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> until that day and<br>finding that there were no more than forty days he declared, ‘This man<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> must have had marital<br>intercourse during her menstrual period’ and having been arrested<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> he confessed?<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> — Samuel was<br>different from other people because his knowledge was exceptional.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup><br>IF SHE ABORTED A SANDAL etc. Our Rabbis taught: A sandal is like a sea-fish [of the same<br>name].<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> At first it is a normal foetus but later it is crushed. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel said: A sandal<br>resembles the tongue of a big ox. In the name of our Masters it was testified: A sandal<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> must have<br>the facial features.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> Rab Judah citing Samuel stated: The halachah is that a sandal<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> must have the<br>facial features. R. Adda citing R. Joseph who had it from R. Isaac ruled: A sandal<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> must have the<br>facial features even if only at the back, this being a case similar to that of a man who slapped his<br>fellow and caused his face to turn backwards.<br>In the days of R. Jannai it was desired to declare [the mother of] a sandal that had no facial<br>features as clean.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> Said R. Jannai to them: You would declare [the mother of newly born] children<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup><br>as clean!<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> — But was it not taught, ‘In the name of our Masters it was testified: A sandal<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> must<br>have the facial features’?<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> — R. Bibi b. Abaye citing R. Johanan replied: It was on the evidence of<br>R. Nehunya<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> that this ruling<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> was learnt.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> R. Ze'ira observed: R. Bibi was lucky [to be the first]<br>with his reported traditions, for both I and he were sitting in the presence of R. Johanan when he<br>discoursed upon this tradition, but he<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> forestalled me and, reporting it first, gained the advantage.<br>Why was a sandal<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> at all mentioned, seeing that there can be no birth of a sandal without that of<br>an embryo with it?<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> — If a female child were to be born with it this would be so indeed,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> but here<br>we are dealing with one with which a male was born.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> As it might have been presumed that, since<br>R. Isaac b. Ammi stated, ‘If the woman is first to emit the semen she bears a male child and if the<br>male is first to do it she bears a female child’, the one<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> is a male as well as the other is a male,<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup><br>hence we were informed [that no such assumption is made, for] it might equally be assumed that<br>both emitted their semen simultaneously so that one might be a male while the other<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> is a female.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup><br>Another explanation:<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> [Sandal<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> was mentioned] in order that if a woman bore a female child before<br>sunset and a sandal after sunset<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> she must count the beginning of her period of menstruation in<br>accordance with the first birth and in accordance with the second birth.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup><br>As regards the sandal that we learnt<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Euphemism.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) The obstruction being attributed to the membrum.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) The splinter test.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Cf. the reading supra <sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>a, ad fin.

The seventh day after the<br>eightieth again is not regarded as the termination of the seven days of menstruation (which began on the eightieth day)<br>since it is possible that the sandal was a female whose eightieth day coincided with the eighty-first of the female child<br>and in accordance with which the woman's seven days of menstruation began a day later (the eighty-second day after the<br>first birth) and consequently terminated a day later.",
        "in the laws of the firstborn,<sup>1</sup> what practical law<sup>2</sup> is thereby taught?<sup>3</sup> — That the son who follows it<sup>4</sup><br>is regarded as a firstborn son in respect of inheritance<sup>5</sup> but not [in regard to his redemption] from the<br>priest.<sup>6</sup> What practical law is taught by that of the sandal of which we learnt in the case of those who<br>incur the penalty of kareth?<sup>7</sup> — That if the embryo<sup>8</sup> is born from her side,<sup>9</sup> and the sandal from her<br>womb she<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> must bring a sacrifice on account of the sandal. But according to R. Simeon who ruled<br>that ‘a foetus born from the side constitutes a valid birth’,<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> what can be said?<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> — R. Jeremiah<br>replied: That if a woman bears the child while she is an idolatress and the sandal after she has been<br>converted [to Judaism] she<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> must bring a sacrifice on account of the sandal.<br>The following was said by the Rabbis before R. Papa: But are all these answers<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> tenable? Was it<br>not in fact taught, ‘When they<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> issue they do so only while clinging to one another’?<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> — R. Papa<br>replied: From this<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> it may be inferred that the embryo clings to the sandal at the middle of the<br>latter<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> which lies across the head of the former.<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> Consequently, as regards the law of the firstborn,<br>[the reference is to a case], for instance, where the embryo<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> issued with its head first<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> so that the<br>sandal<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> issued first.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> As regards the law concerning those punishable by kareth it is a case where<br>they<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> issued with their feet first so that the embryo was born first.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> R. Huna b. Tahlifa citing Raba<br>explained: It may even be said that they<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> cling together side by side, but reverse the previous<br>statement:<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> As regards the law of the firstborn [the reference is to a case] where they<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> issued with<br>their feet first; so that the embryo, being animated hangs on and does not easily come out; while the<br>sandal, not being animated, glides and comes speedily out. As regards the law concerning those<br>subject to the penalty of kareth [the reference is to a case] where they issued with their heads first, so<br>that the embryo, being animated is deemed to have consummated its birth as soon as its head came<br>out; while the sandal [being inanimated cannot be deemed to have been born] until its greater part<br>came out.<br><b>MISHNAH</b>.

Oshaia, the youngest of the fellowship,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> taught:<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> Five things have a prescribed minimum of a<br>handbreadth, and they are the following. A placenta, a shofar, a spine, a sukkah wall and a bundle of<br>hyssop. As to the placenta there is the ruling just mentioned.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> ‘Shofar’?<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> For it was taught: What<br>must be the size of a shofar?<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> R. Simeon b. Gamaliel explained: It must be of such a size as can be<br>held in one's hand and be seen at either end, viz.,<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> a handbreadth.<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> What is meant by ‘spine’? The<br>ruling which R. Parnak laid down in the name of R.

As it was taught: Two<br>walls<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> must be proper ones but the third is valid even if it is only one handbreadth wide. ‘Hyssop’?<br>As R. Hiyya taught: The bundle of hyssop<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> must be a handbreadth long.<br>R. Hanina b. Papa stated: Shila of the village of Tamartha discoursed on three Baraithas and two<br>reported traditions dealing with the prescribed size of a handbreadth. ‘Two’<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> [you say]; is it not<br>only one?<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> — Abaye replied, read:<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> R.

        "the law of ovens of the size of one handbreadth?<sup>1</sup> For we learnt:<sup>2</sup> — An oven [if it is to be<br>susceptible to uncleanness must] ab initio<sup>3</sup> be no less than four handbreadths high, and what remains<br>of it<sup>4</sup> must<sup>5</sup> be no less than four handbreadths high; so R.

But the Sages ruled: This applies<br>only to a big oven but if it is a small one [it is susceptible to uncleanness] ab initio, after its<br>manufacture is completed, whatever its size, and what is left of it [remains unclean] if it was the<br>greater part of it.<sup>6</sup> And [to the question] what is meant by ‘whatever its size’, R. Jannai replied: One<br>handbreadth, since ovens of the height of one handbreadth are made!<sup>7</sup> — He<sup>8</sup> did not speak of laws<br>about which a divergence of view exists.<sup>9</sup> Now that you have arrived at this argument that law<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> [it<br>may be explained]<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> is also one in dispute, for in the final clause it was stated: R. Judah said, They<br>spoke of the length of a handbreadth only between the oven and the wall.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> But is there not also a<br>border of a handbreadth?<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> — He does not deal with sizes that are prescribed in Scripture. But is<br>there not the ark-cover that was one handbreadth thick?<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> — He<sup>8</sup> does not discuss holy things. But is<br>there not [the following law]: It suffices for a cross-beam<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> to be one handbreadth wide?<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> — He<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup><br>does not discuss Rabbinical laws.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> [He was concerned only] with such as are prescribed in Scripture<br>and in connection with which no sizes<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> have been specified.<br>R. Isaac b. Samuel b. Martha once sat at his studies before R. Kahana and in the course of the<br>session he observed: Rab Judah citing Rab laid down that throughout the first three days<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> the<br>placenta<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> is attributed to the child,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> but henceforth the possibility of the birth of a second child<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup><br>must be considered.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> Said the other to him: But could Rab have said such a thing? Did not Rab in<br>fact state, ‘One child is not detained at all after the other [had been born]’?<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> The first remained<br>silent. Said the other to him: Is it not possible that one statement<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> referred to an abortion, while the<br>other<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> referred to a child that was viable? — You, the first<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> answered, have indeed stated Rab's<br>actual rulings, for Rab has explicitly made the following statement: If a woman aborted an embryo<br>and after that she aborted a placenta, if this occurred within three days<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> the placenta is attributed to<br>the embryo, but if it occurred at any subsequent time the possibility of the abortion of a second<br>embryo must be taken into consideration. If, however, she gave birth to a normal child and<br>subsequently aborted a placenta, even if that occurred between that moment and ten days later,<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> the<br>possibility of the abortion of a second child<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> need not be considered at all.<br>Samuel and the disciples of Rab and Rab Judah<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> were once sitting at their studies when R. Joseph<br>the son of R. Menashya of Dewil passed along in great haste. ‘There comes towards us’, he<br>exclaimed, ‘a man whom we can throw down with a piece of straw<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> and he would allow himself to<br>be thrown down and pushed out’.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> In the meanwhile he approached them. What, said Samuel to<br>him, did Rab rule in regard to a placenta? — Thus, the other replied, said Rab: The placenta may be<br>attributed only to a child that is viable.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> Samuel then put the question to all the disciples of Rab and<br>they told him the same thing. Thereupon he turned round and looked at Rab Judah with<br>displeasure.<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup><br>R. Jose b. Saul enquired of Rabbi: What is the law where there was an abortion in the shape of a<br>raven and [this was followed by] a placenta?<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> — The other replied: We can attribute a placenta only<br>to an embryo in whose species<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> the placenta is [one of their organs].<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> What is the law where the<br>placenta is tied to it?<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> — You, the other replied, have asked a question about that which does not<br>exist. He raised an objection against him: If a woman aborted something in the shape of a beast, a<br>wild animal or a bird, and a placenta with them, whenever the placenta is attached to it there is no<br>need to take into consideration the possibility of the existence of a second embryo, but if no placenta<br>is attached to it the possibility of the existence of a second embryo<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> must be considered, and one<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup><br>must [impose on the woman] on account of them<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup><br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Used as toys (cf.

Our Rabbis taught: If a<br>placenta is in a house, the house is unclean; not because a placenta is a child but because generally<br>there can be no placenta with which there is no child; so R. Meir. R. Jose, R. Judah and R. Simeon<br>regard [the house] as clean. ‘Do you not agree’, they said to R. Meir, ‘that if it had been carried out<br>in a bowl into an outer room it would be clean?’ ‘Indeed’, he replied. ‘But why?’<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> ‘Because it<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> is<br>no longer in existence’. ‘As’, they retorted, ‘it is not in existence in the outer room so is it not in<br>existence in the inner room’.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> ‘What was mashed once’, he replied, ‘is not like that which was<br>mashed twice.’<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> R. Papa once sat behind R. Bubi in the presence of R. Hamnuna and in the course<br>of the session he observed: What is R. Simeon's reason?<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> He is of the opinion that any uncleanness<br>with which anything of a different kind of uncleanness has been mixed is neutralized. Said R. Papa<br>to them: ‘Is this also the reason of R. Judah and R. Jose?’<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> They laughed at him. ‘Is not this<br>obvious’, they said, ‘why should there be any difference?’<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> — ‘Even such a question’,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> said R.<br>Papa, ‘a man should submit to his Master<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> and not be content with silence;<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> for it is said, If thou<br>hast done foolishly<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> thou art<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> lifting up thyself;<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> but<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> if thou hast planned devices,<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> lay thy hand<br>upon thy mouth.<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup><br>R. Simeon<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> follows the view he expressed elsewhere. For it was taught: If some earth fell into a<br>ladleful of corpse-mould [the latter remains] unclean, but R. Simeon holds it to be clean. What is R.<br>Simeon's reason? — Raba<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> replied: ‘I met the Rabbis of the schoolhouse while they were sitting at<br>their studies and explaining that<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> it is impossible that [somewhere in the mixture] two particles of<br>earth to one of the corpse-mould should not represent the larger portion, so that<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> something is<br>missing’,<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> and I said to them, ‘On the contrary! It is impossible that [somewhere in the mixture] two<br>particles of the corpse-mould should not represent a part greater than<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) If, for instance, the embryo aborted was a male, the placenta is presumed to contain the crushed embryo of a female,<br>and the woman must, therefore, count fourteen unclean days (as for a female) and not only seven (as prescribed for a<br>male). According to the Rabbis (who do not regard a bird or a beast as a valid birth) the restriction imposed would be to<br>regard ‘neither birth as valid and to deprive the woman in consequence of the advantage of the clean days prescribed for<br>a woman after a childbirth.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Lit., ‘for I say’.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) So that the placenta belonged to that foetus and not to the one in existence.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) That is in existence.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) And lost. Hul. <sup>7</sup><sup>7</sup>a. It is thus shown that a placenta is sometimes attached to the foetus. How then could Rabbi<br>maintain (supra <sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>b ad fin.) that such a thing ‘does not exist’?<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Lit., ‘until’.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Despite the long interval between the birth of the embryo and the expulsion of the placenta no assumption was made<br>that the placenta of the embryo in existence was lost and that the placenta in existence belonged to a second embryo that<br>was crushed.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Lit., ‘and they only said’.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) If, however, it preceded it the possibility must be taken into consideration that it belonged to another embryo that had<br>been crushed; and consequently the restrictions applying to the two embryos must be imposed.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Lit., ‘until’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) So Bah. Cur. edd., ‘R. Isaac’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Of the nine months. Limekuta'in (from a rt. meaning ‘to lop off’).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) Within a day or two.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) In consequence of which it is viable.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) The eighth month consisting of twenty-nine or thirty days together with the odd days of the seventh and the ninth<br>months (cf. prev. n. but one) making up the interval of thirty-three days.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Apparently nothing whatever. If the first was born in the seventh month (even if on the last day) and the second in<br>the ninth month the interval would not be one of thirty-three days but one of no less than two months. If they were both<br>born in the seventh month the interval would inevitably be less than thirty-three days (since a Hebrew month never<br>contains more than thirty days). If again, one was born in the seventh and the other in the eighth month the latter could<br>not be viable, whereas the incident which speaks of a welad (‘child’) and not of nefel (‘abortion’) seems to refer to two<br>viable children.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Of R. Johanan.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) The first incident described supra.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) The second of the incidents supra. This is quite possible where both embryos were born in the seventh month, since<br>all agree that a child may be viable even if the full number of seven months was not completed.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Lit., ‘a woman does not conceive and conceive again’. How then was it possible for a child to be born three months<br>after its predecessor.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Should then the first house be unclean.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Having been mashed in the water.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) Since it was mashed in the placenta.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) ‘There is no comparison between one presumption that the embryo was mashed and two such suppositions (that the<br>placenta of one embryo and the embryo of another placenta were mashed)’. Jast.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) Sc. granted that the embryo was mashed, does not a mashed corpse convey uncleanness?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Who are of the same opinion as R. Simeon supra.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) None whatever (cf. prev. n.).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) Which might cause one to be an object of ridicule.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) To make sure of his tradition.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) By relying on his own intelligence.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Sc. asked what might appear to be a ridiculous question.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) E.V., ‘in’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) One's knowledge is of the highest order and first hand.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) E.V., ‘or’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) In seeking to escape possible ridicule.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) Prov. XXX, <sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>; he will not be able to give an authoritative answer when a question on the subject is addressed to<br>him.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) In his ruling supra that ‘Any uncleanness with which anything of a different kind . . . has been mixed is neutralized’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) So MS.M. and Bah. Cur. edd., ‘Rabbah’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) Though the earth is much less than the corpse-mould.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) Since in that part of the mixture, at least, the corpse-mould is neutralized and loses its uncleanness.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) From the prescribed minimum of a ladleful. The whole mixture is consequently clean.",
        "one particle of earth,<sup>1</sup> so that<sup>2</sup> the quantity is increased’.<sup>3</sup> The fact, however, is, said Raba,<sup>4</sup> that this<br>is the reason of R. Simeon: Its final stage<sup>5</sup> is treated as its first stage.<sup>6</sup> As in its first stage any other<br>matter<sup>7</sup> becomes its antidote<sup>8</sup> so also in its final stage<sup>5</sup> any other matter<sup>9</sup> becomes its antidote,<sup>8</sup> What<br>is that law?<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> — It was taught: In what circumstances is a corpse subject to the uncleanness of<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup><br>corpse-mould and in what circumstances is a corpse not subject to the uncleanness of corpse-mould?<br>If a corpse was buried naked in a marble sarcophagus or on a stone floor<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> it is one that is subject to<br>the uncleanness of corpse-mould. And in what circumstances is a corpse not subject to the<br>uncleanness of corpse-mould? If it was buried in its shroud,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> or in a wooden coffin,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> or on a brick<br>floor<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> it is one that is not subject to the uncleanness of corpse-mould.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> And [the Sages] spoke of<br>the uncleanness of corpse-mould only in the case of one who died, thus excluding a killed person<br>who<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> is not [subject to this law].<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup><br>[To turn to] the main text, ‘If some earth fell into a ladleful of corpse-mould [the latter remains]<br>unclean, but R. Simeon holds it to be clean. If a ladleful of corpse-mould was scattered in a house the<br>house is unclean,<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> but R. Simeon holds it to be clean’.<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> And both these rulings were required. For<br>if we had been informed of the first one only<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> it might have been presumed that only in that case do<br>the Rabbis maintain their view,<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> since it<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> is collected together but that where it was scattered they<br>agree with R. Simeon, since a succession of incomplete overshadowings<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> is of no consequence.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup><br>And if we had been informed of the latter only<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> it might have been presumed that only in that case<br>does R. Simeon maintain his view,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> since a succession of incomplete overshadowings<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> is of no<br>consequence,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> but that in the former case<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> he agrees with the Rabbis.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> Hence both were required.<br>Elsewhere we learnt:<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> A ladleful and more of the earth of a graveyard<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> is unclean,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> but R.<br>Simeon regards it as clean.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> What is the reason of the Rabbis? — Because it is impossible to have ‘a<br>ladleful<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> and more’ of the earth of a graveyard in which there is not contained a ladleful of<br>corpse-mould.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup><br>Now that you have explained that R. Simeon's reason is because ‘its final stage is treated as its<br>first stage’,<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> what could be his reason in the case of a PLACENTA?<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> — R. Johanan replied:<br>Because the law of neutralization in the larger quantity<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> has been applied to it.<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> R. Johanan in fact<br>follows here<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> a view he expressed elsewhere. For R. Johanan stated: R. Simeon and R. Eliezer b.<br>Jacob laid down the same ruling.<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> R. Simeon laid down the ruling we have just spoken of.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> R.<br>Eliezer [also laid down the same ruling] for we learnt:<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> R. Eliezer b. Jacob ruled, If a beast<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> of the<br>class of large cattle discharged a clot of blood, this<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> shall be buried<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> and [the beast] is exempt from<br>the law of the firstling;<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> and in connection with this R. Hiyya taught: It<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> does not convey<br>uncleanness either through touch or through carriage.<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> But since it conveys no uncleanness either<br>through touch or through carriage<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> why<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> should it be buried? — In order to publish the fact that<br>[the beast] is exempt from the law of the firstling. It thus clearly follows that it<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> is deemed to be a<br>proper embryo,<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> then why did R. Hiyya teach, ‘It does not convey uncleanness either through touch<br>or through carriage’? — R. Johanan replied: Because the law of neutralization in the larger<br>quantity<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> has been applied to it,<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup><br>R. Ammi citing R. Johanan stated: R. Simeon, however,<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> agrees that its mother is unclean by<br>reason of childbirth. Said a certain old man to R. Ammi: ‘I will explain to you R. Johanan's reason:<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup><br>For Scripture says, If a woman conceived seed<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> and bore a man-child etc.,<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> which implies: Even if<br>she bore in the same manner only as she ‘conceived seed’<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> she is unclean by reason of childbirth.<br>Resh Lakish ruled: A sac that was beaten up in its fluid assumes the same status as a corpse whose<br>shape was destroyed.<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> Said R. Johanan to Resh Lakish: Whence do we infer that a corpse whose<br>shape had been destroyed is clean? If it be suggested, From the following statement which R.<br>Shabthai cited in the name of R. Isaac of Magdala or, as others say, R. Isaac of Magdala cited in the<br>name of R. Shabthai, ‘If a corpse has been burnt but its shape remained<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> it is unclean. It once<br>happened that on account of such a corpse<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> the big<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> doors<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> were declared unclean<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup><br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) With which they are mixed in that particular section.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) The earth also becoming unclean on account of the greater part of the corpse-mould with which it is mixed.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) We-nafish (cf. marg. n. and Bomb. ed.)

        "but the small doors<sup>1</sup> were declared clean’; from which you infer that the reason [why the big doors<br>were declared unclean is] because its shape is still intact but had it not been in such a condition they<sup>2</sup><br>would have been clean; on the contrary [it could be retorted] draw from this the following<br>inference:<sup>3</sup> Only when its shape is intact were the small doors declared clean but otherwise the small<br>doors also are unclean, since everyone of them is fit for carrying through it one limb at a time.<sup>4</sup> Said<br>Rabina to R. Ashi: [Do you know] in agreement with whose view R. Johanan made his statement?<sup>5</sup><br>In agreement with that of R. Eliezer, For we learnt: The ashes of burnt corpses, R. Eliezer ruled,<br>[convey uncleanness] if they are a quarter of a kab in quantity.<sup>6</sup> How is one to imagine a corpse that<br>was burnt but whose shape remained intact? — Abaye replied: In such a case, for instance, as where<br>it was burnt on a leather spread.<sup>7</sup> Raba replied: In such a case, for instance, as where it was burnt on<br>a hard cemented substance.<sup>8</sup> Rabina replied: Where, for instance, it was only charred.<sup>9</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: If a woman aborted a shaped<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> hand or a shaped<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> foot she<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> is subject to the<br>uncleanness of childbirth and there is no need to consider the possibility that it might have come<br>from a shapeless body.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> Both R. Hisda and Rabbah b. R. Huna ruled: She<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> is not allowed the days<br>of cleanness.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> What is the reason? — It might be assumed that<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> her bearing took place long ago.<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup><br>R. Joseph raised an objection: If a woman aborted an embryo and<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> it is unknown what [was the sex<br>of the embryo] she aborted she must continue [her periods of uncleanness and cleanness as] for both<br>a male child and a female child.<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> Now if it is to be upheld<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> that in any such case<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> it might be<br>assumed that her bearing took place long ago,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> why<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> was it not also stated, ‘and as for<br>menstruation’?<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> — Abaye replied: If ‘as for menstruation’ had been mentioned it might have been<br>presumed that<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> she brings a sacrifice<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> which<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> may not be eaten; hence we were informed<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> that it<br>may be eaten.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup><br>R. Huna ruled: If an embryo put forth its hand and then drew it back its mother is unclean on<br>account of childbirth; for it is said, And it came to pass, when she bore,<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> that one put out a hand.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup><br>Rab Judah raised an objection: If an embryo put forth its hand its mother need not consider the<br>possibility of any restriction!<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> — R. Nahman replied: This was explained to me by R. Huna that the<br>woman must indeed consider the possibility [that it is a valid birth],<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> but we do not allow her the<br>privilege of the clean days<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> unless the greater part of the embryo has issued forth. But was it not<br>stated ‘Its mother need not consider the possibility of any restriction’? — Abaye replied:<br>Pentateuchally she need not consider the possibility of any restriction, but it is Rabbinically that she<br>must take into consideration the possibility [that it might have constituted a valid birth]. But did he<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup><br>not quote a Scriptural text?<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> — The restriction is Rabbinical, and the Scriptural text is a mere<br>prop.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup><br><b>MISHNAH</b>. IF A WOMAN ABORTED A TUMTUM OR AN ANDROGINOS,<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> SHE MUST<br>CONTINUE [IN HER UNCLEANNESS AND CLEANNESS AS] FOR BOTH A MALE<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> AND A<br>FEMALE,<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> IF SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A TUMTUM AND A MALE, OR TO AN ANDROGINOS<br>AND A MALE, SHE MUST ALSO CONTINUE [IN UNCLEANNESS AND CLEANNESS AS]<br>FOR BOTH A MALE<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> AND A FEMALE.<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> IF SHE HAVE A TUMTUM AND A FEMALE OR<br>AN ANDROGINOS AND A FEMALE, SHE NEED CONTINUE [IN UNCLEANNESS AS] FOR<br>A FEMALE ONLY.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> IF THE EMBRYO ISSUED IN PIECES<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> OR IN A REVERSED<br>POSITION<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> IT IS DEEMED BORN AS SOON AS ITS GREATER PART ISSUED FORTH. IF IT<br>CAME FORTH IN THE NORMAL WAY [IT IS NOT DEEMED BORN] UNTIL THE GREATER<br>PART OF ITS HEAD ISSUED FORTH. AND WHAT IS MEANT [BY THE ISSUE OF] THE<br>‘GREATER PART OF ITS HEAD’? THE ISSUE<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> OF ITS FOREHEAD.<br><b>GEMARA</b>. Now that it has been laid down that for a TUMTUM alone or for an ANDROGINOS<br>alone SHE MUST CONTINUE [IN HER UNCLEANNESS AND CLEANNESS AS] FOR BOTH A<br>MALE AND A FEMALE, why should it again be necessary [to state that the same law applies<br>where she gave birth to] A TUMTUM AND A MALE OR TO AN ANDROGINOS AND A MALE?<br>— This was necessary: As it might have been suggested that since R. Isaac had stated, ‘If the woman<br>emits her semen first she bears a male and if the man emits his first she bears a female’,<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> it should<br>be assumed that since the one is a male the other<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> also is a male, hence we were informed [that no<br>such assumption is made, since] it might equally be assumed that both<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> emitted their semen<br>simultaneously, the one resulting in a male and the other in a female.<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> R. Nahman citing Rab ruled:<br>If a tumtum or an androginos observed a white,<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> or a red<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> discharge he<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> does not incur the<br>obligation of an offering for entering the Sanctuary<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> nor is terumah<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> to be burnt on his account.<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> If<br>he<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> observed a simultaneous discharge of white and red,<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> he incurs indeed no obligation of an<br>offering for entering the Sanctuary<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> but terumah<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> must be burnt on his account;<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> for<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> it is said,<br>Both male and female<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Less than four handbreadths in width, through which, owing to the availability of larger doors, the corpse would not<br>be carried.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) The big doors,<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘to that side’.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) From which it would follow that ‘a corpse whose shape had been destroyed’ is also unclean; contrary to the view of<br>Resh Lakish (supra <sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>b, ad fin.).<br>(<sup>5</sup>) That a corpse whose shape had been destroyed is also unclean (cf. prev. n.).<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Oh.

(On the mention of male child v. infra <sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>a).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) Since the ruling that the woman is subject to the restrictions of menstruation implies that it is not certain whether the<br>embryo is, or is not to be regarded as a normal child.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Prescribed for a woman after a childbirth.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) As the embryo possibly may not have the status of a normal child (cf. prev. n. but one).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) By the omission of ‘as for menstruation’ which indicates that there is no doubt whatever that the embryo is in this<br>respect regarded as a normal child, and that it was only its sex that was in doubt.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) As any other valid sacrifice brought by a woman after a childbirth.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) E.

        "shall ye put out,<sup>1</sup> only a confirmed male or a confirmed female [shall ye put out], but not a tumtum<br>or an androginos. May it be suggested that the following provides support for his<sup>2</sup> view? [For it was<br>taught:] ‘If a tumtum or an androginos observed a white,<sup>3</sup> or a red discharge, he incurs no obligation<br>of an offering for entering the Sanctuary nor is terumah to be burnt on his account. If he observed a<br>simultaneous discharge of white and red he incurs indeed no obligation of an offering for entering<br>the Sanctuary but terumah must be burnt on his account’. Now is not the reason<sup>4</sup> because it is said,<br>Both male and female shall ye put out,<sup>5</sup> which implies only a confirmed male and a confirmed<br>female [shall ye put out] but not a tumtum or an androginos?<sup>6</sup> — ‘Ulla replied: No; this may<br>represent the view of<sup>7</sup> R. Eliezer.<sup>8</sup> For we learnt: R. Eliezer stated, [It is written, If any one touch . . .<br>the carcass of] unclean swarming things and . . . it being hidden from him,<sup>9</sup> one incurs the obligation<br>of an offering only when the unclean swarming thing is hidden from him<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> but no offering is<br>incurred when the Sanctuary is hidden from him.<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> R. Akiba stated, [Scripture says:] It being hidden<br>from him that he is unclean,<sup>9</sup> one incurs the obligation of an offering only when it is ‘hidden from<br>him that he is unclean’<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> but no offering is incurred when the Sanctuary is hidden from him.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> And<br>when it was asked, ‘What is the practical difference between them?’<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> Hezekiah replied: The<br>practical difference between them is [the case of a man who is uncertain whether he touched] a dead<br>creeping thing or the carcass of a beast, R. Eliezer<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> holding that it is necessary<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> that a person shall<br>know<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> whether he had contracted uncleanness through a creeping thing or through the carcass of a<br>beast, while R. Akiba<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> maintains that this is not necessary.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> Now did not R. Eliezer state there<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup><br>that ‘it is necessary that a person should know whether he contracted uncleanness through a creeping<br>thing or the carcass of a beast’?<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> Well here also<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> it is necessary<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> that the person<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> should know<br>whether he became unclean on account of the white discharge or an account of the red one; but<br>according to R. Akiba who stated that a person incurs the obligation of an offering on account of<br>uncleanness<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> an offering would be incurred here<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> also on account of the uncleanness.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> But,<br>according to Rab, why is it that they<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> incur no offering for entering the Sanctuary? Because [you<br>say] it is written, Both male and female shall ye put out,<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> which implies that only a confirmed male<br>and a confirmed female [must be put out] but not a tumtum or an androginos. But, if so, terumah<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup><br>also should not be burnt, since it is written, And of them that have an issue, whether it be a man, or a<br>woman,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> which implies<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> does it not, that only a confirmed male and a confirmed female [is subject<br>to the restrictions]<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> but not a tumtum or an androginos?<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> — That text<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> is required for an<br>exposition like the one made by R. Isaac; for R. Isaac stated: ‘whether it be a man’<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> includes<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> a<br>male leper as regards his sources,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> ‘or a woman’<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> includes a female leper as regards her sources.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup><br>But is not that text<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> also required [for a deduction that the injunction<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> applies only] to that which<br>may attain cleanness in a ritual bath,<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> thus excluding an earthenware vessel;<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> so R. Jose?<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> — If<br>so<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> the All Merciful should have written, ‘man’.<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> And should you retort that if the All Merciful had<br>only written ‘man’ it might have been presumed that a metal vessel need not be sent out<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> [it may be<br>pointed out that this<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> could have been] deduced from Whatsoever<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> is unclean by the dead,<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> what<br>need then was there for the specification of ‘male and female’? Obviously to deduce the same ruling<br>as Rab did. Might it not then be suggested that the entire text served the same purpose as that to<br>which Rab applied it?<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> — If that were the case<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> it should have been written, ‘male and female’<br>why then the expression ‘both male and female’?<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> ‘Both’<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> consequently includes all objects that<br>attain cleanness in a ritual bath. But if so,<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> even if he<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> became unclean through any other cause of<br>uncleanness,<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> he should not be sent out, should he?<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> — Scripture said, ‘from<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> male’ [implying<br>that the text deals only with] an uncleanness that is discharged from the male.<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> Does, however, any<br>Scriptural expression of ‘both male and female’ serve to exclude the tumtum and the androginos?<br>Surely in the case of valuations it is written, ‘The male’,<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> and it was taught: ‘The male’<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> but no<br>tumtum or androginos. As it might have been presumed that he is not subject to the valuation of a<br>man but is subject to that of a woman it was explicitly stated. ‘The male<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> . . . And if it be a<br>female’<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> implying:<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> Only a confirmed male and a confirmed female<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> but no tumtum or<br>androginos.<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> Is not then the reason [for the exclusion]<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> that it was written, ‘The male<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> . . . And if it<br>be a female’,<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> but from the expression of ‘male and female’ alone neither<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> could have been<br>excluded?<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> — That text<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> is required<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Num.

Similarly in the case cited, since the actual cause of uncleanness is<br>unknown to the tumtum or to the androginos, no obligation of an offering is incurred. The Rabbis, however, who differ<br>from R. Eliezer in subjecting one to the obligation of an offering even where the actual cause of the uncleanness is<br>unknown, would equally subject the tumtum and the androginos to the obligation of an offering in the case cited.

Eleazar<br>ruled: Even if the head was with them;<sup>2</sup> but R. Johanan ruled: This<sup>3</sup> was learnt only in a case where<br>the head was not with them but where the head was with them the embryo is deemed born.<sup>4</sup> May it<br>be suggested that they<sup>5</sup> differ on a principle of Samuel for Samuel has laid down: The head<sup>6</sup> does not<br>exempt<sup>7</sup> in the case of miscarriages?<sup>8</sup> — Where it<sup>9</sup> is whole there is no difference of opinion<br>whatever;<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> they only differ in a case where it<sup>9</sup> issued in pieces, one Master<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> holding the opinion<br>that the head is of importance<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> only where the miscarriage is whole but where it is in pieces it is of<br>no importance, while the other Master<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> holds that even where it<sup>9</sup> is in pieces the head is of<br>importance.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> There<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> are some who teach this passage as an independent discussion:<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> R. Eleazar<br>ruled, The head<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> has not the status of the greater part of the limbs<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> but R. Johanan ruled: The head<br>has the same status as the greater part of the limbs. They thus differ on the validity of Samuel's<br>principle.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup><br>We learnt: IF THE EMBRYO ISSUED IN PIECES OR IN A REVERSED POSITION IT IS<br>DEEMED BORN AS SOON AS ITS GREATER PART ISSUED FORTH. Now since ‘OR<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> IN A<br>REVERSED POSITION’ was specifically stated it follows that ‘IN PIECES’ refers to one that<br>issued in a normal position,<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> and yet it was stated, IT IS DEEMED BORN AS SOON AS ITS<br>GREATER PART ISSUED. Does not this then present an objection against R. Johanan? — R.<br>Johanan can answer you: Read, ISSUED IN PIECES and IN A REVERSED POSITION. But was it<br>not stated ‘OR’?<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> It is this that was meant: IF THE EMBRYO ISSUED IN PIECES OR whole, but<br>in either case, IN A REVERSED POSITION, IT IS DEEMED BORN AS SOON AS ITS<br>GREATER PART ISSUED FORTH. R. Papa stated, [This<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> is] a matter of dispute between the<br>following Tannas: ‘If an embryo issued in pieces or in a reversed position it is deemed born as soon<br>as its greater part issued forth. R. Jose ruled: Only when it issued in the normal way’. What does he<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup><br>mean? — R. Papa replied: It is this that was meant:<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> If the embryo issued in pieces and in a reversed<br>position<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> it is deemed born as soon as its greater part issued forth, but [it follows] if it issued in the<br>normal way<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> the head alone<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> causes exemption.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> R. Jose ruled: Only where its greater part issued<br>in the normal manner.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> R. Zebid demurred:<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> Thus it follows<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> that where the embryo issued in a<br>reversed position<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> even the issue of its greater part causes no exemption,<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> but surely, have we not<br>an established rule that the greater part<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> counts as the whole? Rather, said R. Zebid, it is this that<br>was meant:<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> If the embryo issued in pieces and in a reversed position it is deemed born as soon as<br>its greater part issued forth, but [it follows] if it issued in the normal way the head alone causes<br>exemption.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> R. Jose<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> ruled: Only<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> where it issued in the normal manner in a condition of<br>viability.<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> So it was also taught: If the embryo issued in pieces and<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> in a reversed position it is<br>deemed born as soon as its greater part issued forth, but, it follows, if it issued in the normal way the<br>head alone causes exemption. R. Jose ruled: Only when it issued in the normal manner in a condition<br>of viability. And what is ‘the normal manner in a condition of viability’? The issue<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> of the greater<br>part of its head. And what is meant by ‘the greater part of its head’? R. Jose<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> said: The issue of its<br>temples. Abba Hanan citing R. Joshua said: The issue of its forehead; and some say: The<br>appearance<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> of the corners of its head.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup><br><b>MISHNAH</b>.

But<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> why should she continue as a menstruant. Why<br>should it not be said, ‘Be guided by the nature of the majority of women and the majority of women<br>bear normal children’.<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> — Our Mishnah deals with a case where there was no presumption of the<br>existence of an embryo,<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> while R. Joshua b.

[Why not] be guided by the majority of beasts and, since the majority of beasts<br>bear normal young, this one also<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> must be an ordinary beast?<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> — Rabina replied, Because it may<br>be said: Most beasts bear young that are exempt from the law of the firstling<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> and a minority of<br>them bear young that are not exempt from the law of the firstling but all that bear secrete,<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> and in<br>the case of this beast, since it did not secrete, the majority rule has been impaired. If, however, all<br>that bear secrete, must not the young, since this beast did not secrete, be a valid firstling?<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> — Rather<br>say: Most of those that bear secrete, and in the case of this beast, since it did not secrete, the majority<br>rule is impaired. When Rabin came<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> he stated: ‘R. Jose b.

Now<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> one can well understand why the woman may not perform her<br>marital duty during the first week,<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> since she might be presumed to have given birth<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> to a male<br>child.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> During the second week she might be presumed to have given birth<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> to a female child.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup><br>During the third week she might be presumed to have given birth<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> to a female child while she was<br>in the condition of a zabah.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> But<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> why should she<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> not be permitted to perform her marital duty in<br>the fourth week though she had observed a discharge of blood seeing that it is clean blood?<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> Must it<br>not then be admitted that the reason<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> is because we are not guided here by the majority rule?<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> —<br>What then<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> [is the justification for the statement] ‘I do not know what objection it was’?-It might be<br>presumed that her delivery took place a long time ago.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> But why should she not be allowed to<br>perform her marital duty during the fifth week<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> which<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> is a clean one? — In the case of the fourth<br>week<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> every day might be regarded as being possibly the conclusion of [the clean days prescribed<br>for] a childbirth and the beginning of the period of menstruation, so that the twenty-eighth day<br>itself<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> might be presumed to be the first day of the menstrual period and she must consequently<br>continue [her uncleanness for] seven days in respect of her menstruation.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> But why should she not<br>be permitted to perform her marital duty on the twenty-first day?<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> — This<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> is in agreement with<br>the view of R.

After that night, however, as will be explained presently, no<br>cohabitation can be allowed.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) One after each period of uncleanness as will be explained presently.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Cf. prev. n. mut. mut.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Here begins the ‘objection’ to which Rabin referred (supra <sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>a ad fin.).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) After her return. ‘First week’ includes the day of her return.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) During her absence and immediately before her return.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) So that everyone of the first seven days might be one of the seven unclean days prescribed for a woman after a male<br>childbirth.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) The period of uncleanness after whose birth is two weeks (cf. prev. n. mut. mut.).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) I.e., during the ‘eleven days’ that intervene between the menstrual periods. Since it is possible that she experienced<br>painless discharges on three consecutive days during this period she must, in addition to the fourteen days (cf. prev. n.),<br>wait a period of another seven clean days (irrespective of whether she did, or did not observe any discharge during the<br>fourteen days) before she can attain to cleanness.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) If R. Joshua b. Levi's rule, that most women bear normal children, is tenable.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Who was known to be pregnant before her departure (v. supra), and who must, therefore, (cf. prev. n.) be presumed<br>to have given birth to a normal child.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Since the fourth week is inevitably excluded from the unclean periods (seven days for a male and fourteen for a<br>female) that follow childbirth, and included in the thirty-three clean days prescribed for a male birth.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Why the woman is treated as unclean even during the fourth week.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) So that there is no presumption of the birth of any child and no consequent allowance of any period of clean blood.<br>How then could R. Joshua b. Levi, contrary to this Baraitha, maintain that in such cases the majority rule is followed?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) In view of the forceful objection just advanced.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) And her clean blood period also has terminated long before the fourth week. The Baraitha would consequently<br>present no objection against R. Joshua b. Levi, since the tenability of his majority rule in no way affects the uncleanness<br>of the fourth week, while, as regards the imposition upon the woman of the obligation of the sacrifice prescribed for one<br>after childbirth, the rule is in fact upheld even in this case.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) I.e., on any of its seven days and not only (as laid down supra) on the night preceding the last one (the thirty-fifth<br>day).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) Since the ten weeks were alternately unclean and clean.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) On every day of which she suffered a discharge.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) The last day of the fourth week.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) Which, beginning on the last day of the fourth week, terminates on the sixth day of the fifth week. Hence the<br>permissibility of marital duty (after due ritual immersion) on the night following that day (the one preceding the<br>thirty-fifth day of her return). During the weeks that follow all intercourse would be forbidden, since each alternate<br>‘clean’ week might he regarded as the period of seven days that must be allowed to elapse after the zibah of the previous<br>‘unclean’ week before cleanness is attained.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) Of her return. This day (the last one of the third week) must inevitably be a clean one. For even if the woman had<br>been delivered on the very day of her return her period of childbirth uncleanness would have terminated (even in the<br>case of a female child) on the fourteenth day, while the seven days following could be counted as the prescribed seven<br>days following a period of zibah on the last of which she is permitted to perform ritual immersion at any time of the day<br>and to attain to a state of cleanness (cf. Yoma <sup>6</sup>a) for the rest of that day.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) The prohibition of intercourse on the twenty-first day.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) To have intercourse on the seventh day after the termination of a zibah even though ritual immersion had been<br>performed.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) If she happened to suffer a discharge later in the day after intercourse.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) Of zibah. A discharge on the seventh day following the termination of zibah renders void all the previous counting,<br>since the seven clean days must be complete.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) Since on the twenty-first day she was still clean and her first discharge in the following (fourth) week occurred<br>presumably on the twenty-second day.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) Following the twenty-first day.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) Cf. prev. n. And similarly in the case of all the alternate unclean weeks the discharges occurred in the evenings.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) After her return.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) Seven days previously.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) So that each day of the first week might possibly be the first one after the termination of the unclean days and it is a<br>religious duty to perform ritual immersion immediately after the unclean days had terminated.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) Cf. Bah for a different reading.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) Fourteen days previously.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) So that each day of the first week counted as the sixth of the clean days after zibah which (cf. supra n. <sup>5</sup>) must be<br>immediately followed (during the day-time of the following day) by ritual immersion.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) Cf. prev. n. mut. mut.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) The fourteen unclean days (after which the woman performs immersion) and the sixty-six clean days that follow<br>(during which she is forbidden to eat terumah) are regarded as one long day on which immersion had been performed<br>and sunset is awaited (sunset being represented by that of the eightieth day after childbirth) to complete and terminate ail<br>traces of uncleanness.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) Sc. on the night following the eightieth day and preceding the eighty-first one. As every day of the third week might<br>possibly be the eightieth, immersion must be performed on every night of that week. The same reason could, of course,<br>be given for the necessity for immersion in the previous weeks had there been no other reasons to justify it.",
        "Consider!

Now, sixty<br>minus one and thirty-five<sup>7</sup> are ninety-four, how then is the number of ninety-five obtained?<sup>8</sup> — R.<br>Jeremiah of Difti replied: This is a case, for instance, where the woman<sup>9</sup> made her appearance before<br>us at twilight,<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> so that<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> we impose upon her an additional immersion.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> According to Beth Hillel,<br>however, who maintain that one who performed immersion on a long day<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> requires no immersion<br>[at the conclusion]<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> how is the number thirty-five obtained?<sup>8</sup> — Twenty-eight, as has been<br>explained,<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> while during the fifth week we require the woman to undergo immersion every night,<br>since<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> it might be assumed [that each day<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> is the] last of the days of her menstruation.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> What need<br>was there for the mention of ten weeks<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> seeing that eight and a half<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> would suffice?<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> — Since he<br>had to mention half a week he mentioned all of it, and since he had to mention an unclean week<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> he<br>also mentioned a clean one.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> But are there [not also the additional] immersions<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> due to the<br>possibility of the woman's being a zabah?<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> They<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> only count the immersions before intercourse<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup><br>but not those that follow. But according to Beth Shammai who<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> count also the immersions that<br>follow intercourse, why was no mention made of the immersions that are due to the possibility of the<br>woman's being a zabah? — They<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> only deal with immersions that are occasioned by childbirth but<br>do not discuss those that are due to zibah. Is there then [no mention of the possibility that the woman<br>might have] given birth to a child while she was in a condition of zibah?<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> — They do take note of<br>the ‘possibility of a birth in a condition of zibah, but no note is taken of zibah alone. Why should not<br>the woman perform immersion in the day-time of each of the days of the first week after she<br>appeared before us, seeing that it is possible that her counting<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> ended on that day?<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> — This is in<br>agreement with<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> R. Akiba who ruled: It is required that the counting<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> shall take place within our<br>cognizance.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> But why should she not perform immersion at the end of the first week?<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> — They do<br>not discuss one day of a week. But why should she not perform immersion on the first day she comes<br>to us, seeing that it is possible that she is awaiting a day for a day?<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> — They deal with a major<br>zabah<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> but not with a minor one.<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> Three rulings may thus be inferred: It may be inferred that it was<br>R. Akiba who ruled that the counting<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> must take place within our cognizance; and it may be<br>inferred that it was R. Simeon who stated, ‘The Sages have truly laid down that it is forbidden to do<br>so since thereby she might be involved in a doubtful uncleanness’;<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> and it may also be inferred that<br>it is a religious duty to perform immersion at the proper time.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> R.

ISHMAEL RULED: [IF SHE MISCARRled ON] THE FORTY-FIRST DAY SHE<br>CONTINUES [HER PERIODS OF UNCLEANNESS AND CLEANNESS AS] FOR A MALE AND<br>AS FOR A MENSTRUANT etc. It was taught: R. Ishmael stated, Scripture prescribed uncleanness<sup>9</sup><br>and cleanness<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> in respect of a male<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> and it also prescribed uncleanness<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> and cleanness<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> in respect<br>of a female,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> as in the case of the former<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> his fashioning period<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> corresponds to his unclean and<br>clean periods<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> so also in the case of the latter<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> her fashioning period<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> corresponds to her unclean<br>and clean periods.<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> They<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> replied: The duration of the fashioning period cannot be derived from<br>that of uncleanness. Furthermore, they said to R. Ishmael, A story is told of Cleopatra the queen of<br>Alexandria<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> that when her handmaids were sentenced to death by royal decree they<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> were<br>subjected to a test<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> and it was found that both [a male and a female embryo] were fully fashioned on<br>the forty-first day. He replied: I bring you proof from the Torah and you bring proof from some<br>fools! But what was his ‘proof from the Torah’? If it was the argument, ‘Scripture prescribed<br>uncleanness and cleanness in respect of a male and it also prescribed uncleanness and cleanness in<br>respect of a female etc.’, have they not already replied, ‘The duration of the fashioning period cannot<br>be derived from that of uncleanness’? — The Scriptural text says, She bear,<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> Scripture thus<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup><br>doubles the ante-natal period<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> in the case of a female.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> But why [should the test spoken of by the<br>Rabbis be described as] ‘proof from some fools’? — It might be suggested that the conception of the<br>female preceded that of the male by forty days.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> And the Rabbis?<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> — They<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> were made to drink<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup><br>a scattering drug<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> And R.

They replied: No one adduces proof from fools.

But<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> is it not possible that if a surgical operation had been performed on the<br>forty-first day the female embryo also might have been found in a fully fashioned condition like the<br>male?<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> — Abaye replied: They<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> were equal as far as these distinguishing marks were concerned.<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup><br>THE SAGES, HOWEVER, MAINTAIN THAT BOTH THE FASHIONING OF THE MALE<br>AND THE FASHIONING OF THE FEMALE etc. Is not the ruling of the Sages identical with that<br>of the first Tanna?<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> And should you reply that the object<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> was to indicate that the anonymous<br><b>MISHNAH</b> represented the view of the Rabbis because when an individual is opposed by many the<br>halachah is in agreement with the many, is not this<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> obvious?<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> — It might have been presumed that<br>R. Ishmael's reason is acceptable since it is also supported by a Scriptural text,<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> hence we were<br>informed<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> [that the halachah is in agreement with the Sages].<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup><br>R. Simlai delivered the following discourse: What does an embryo resemble when it is in the<br>bowels of its mother? Folded writing tablets.<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> Its hands rest on its two temples respectively, its two<br>elbows on its two legs and its two heels against its buttocks. Its head lies between its knees, its<br>mouth is closed and its navel is open, and it eats what its mother eats and drinks what its mother<br>drinks, but produces no excrements because otherwise it might kill its mother. As soon, however, as<br>it sees the light<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> the closed organ<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> opens and the open one<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> closes, for if that had not happened the<br>embryo could not live even one single hour. A light burns above its head and it looks and sees from<br>one end of the world to the other, as it is said, then his lamp shined above my head, and by His light<br>I walked through darkness.<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> And do not be astonished at this, for a person sleeping here<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> might see<br>a dream in Spain. And there is no time in which a man enjoys greater happiness than in those days,<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup><br>for it is said, O that I were as the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me;<sup>6</sup><sup>4</sup> now<br>which are the days’ that make up ‘months’<sup>6</sup><sup>5</sup> and do not make up years? The months of pregnancy of<br>course.<sup>6</sup><sup>6</sup> It is also taught all the Torah from beginning to end,<sup>6</sup><sup>7</sup> for it is said, And he taught me, and<br>said unto me: ‘Let thy heart hold fast my words, keep my commandments and live’,<sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup> and it is also<br>said, When the converse of God was upon my tent.<sup>6</sup><sup>9</sup> Why the addition of<sup>7</sup><sup>0</sup> ‘and it is also said’? —<br>In case you might say that it was only the prophet who said that,<sup>7</sup><sup>1</sup> come and hear ‘when the<br>converse of God was upon my tent.<sup>6</sup><sup>9</sup> As soon as it, sees the light an angel approaches, slaps it on its<br>mouth and causes it to forget all the Torah completely,<sup>6</sup><sup>7</sup> as it is said, Sin coucheth at the door.<sup>7</sup><sup>2</sup> It<br>does not emerge from there before it is made to take an oath,<sup>7</sup><sup>3</sup> as it is said, That unto Me every knee<br>shall bow, every tongue shall swear;<sup>7</sup><sup>4</sup> ‘That unto Me every knee shall bow’ refers to the day of<br>dying of which it is said All they that go down to the dust shall kneel before Him;<sup>7</sup><sup>5</sup> ‘Every tongue<br>shall swear’ refers to the day of birth of which it is said, He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart,<br>who hath not taken My name<sup>7</sup><sup>6</sup> in vain, and hath not sworn deceitfully.<sup>7</sup><sup>7</sup> What is the nature of the<br>oath that it is made to take? Be righteous, and be never wicked; and even if all the world tells you,<br>You are righteous’, consider yourself wicked.<sup>7</sup><sup>8</sup> Always bear in mind<sup>7</sup><sup>9</sup> that the Holy One, blessed be<br>He, is pure, that his ministers are pure and that the soul which He gave you is pure; if you preserve it<br>in purity, well and good, but if not, I will take it away from you. The school of R. Ishmael taught:<br>This may be compared to the case of a priest who handled over some terumah to an ‘am ha-arez and<br>told him, ‘If you preserve it under conditions of cleanness, well and good, but if not, I will burn it in<br>your presence’. R. Eleazar<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Whose discharges of blood are invariably unclean whatever the day.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) When she is held to be unclean on account of possible menstruation, though the day is only (<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> — <sup>7</sup> = <sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) the<br>twenty-seventh of the thirty-three clean days prescribed for a male birth.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Which is the eighth day after the discharge on the thirty-fourth.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Despite the previous assumption of menstruation on the thirty-fourth day, which would put the forty-first day outside<br>the seven days of the menstruation period (when the observation of a discharge necessitates the waiting of no more than<br>one single day).<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Lit., ‘damaged’.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) It being assumed that the miscarriage was a male and that the thirty-fourth day was therefore still within the<br>thirty-three clean days prescribed for a male birth, so that the second discharge on the forty-first day was the first<br>menstrual one after the completion of the thirty-three clean days in consequence of which she must wait another seven<br>days to complete the menstruation period.

        "observed: What is the Scriptural proof?<sup>1</sup> From my mother's womb Thou art gozi.<sup>2</sup> What is the proof<br>that ‘gozi’ implies ‘swearing’? — Because it is written, Swear [gozi] concerning thy naziriteship and<br>cast away.<sup>3</sup><br>R. Eleazar further stated: What does an embryo resemble when it is in its mother's bowels? A nut<br>floating in a bowl of water. Should someone put his finger upon it, it would sink on the one side or<br>on the other.<br>Our Rabbis taught: During the first three months<sup>4</sup> the embryo occupies the lowest chamber, during<br>the middle ones it occupies the middle chamber and during the last months it occupies the uppermost<br>chamber; and when its time to emerge arrives it turns over and then emerges, and this is the cause of<br>the woman's pains.<sup>5</sup> This also agrees with what was taught:<sup>6</sup> The pains of a female birth are more<br>intense than those of a male birth. R. Eleazar further observed, ‘What is the Scriptural proof for<br>this?<sup>7</sup> When I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth;<sup>8</sup> it does not<br>say ‘dwelt’ but ‘curiously wrought’.<sup>9</sup> Why are the pains of a female birth greater than those of a<br>male birth? — The female emerges in the position she assumes during intercourse and the male<br>emerges in the position he assumes during intercourse. The former, therefore, turns her face<br>upwards<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> while the latter<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> need not turn his face.<br>Our Rabbis taught: During the first three months<sup>4</sup> marital intercourse is injurious to the woman<br>and it is also injurious to the child. During the middle ones it is injurious to the woman but beneficial<br>for the child. During the last months it is beneficial for both the woman and the child, since on<br>account of it the child becomes well-formed and of strong vitality.<br>One taught: He who indulges in marital intercourse on the ninetieth day<sup>4</sup> is as though he had shed<br>blood. But whence could one know this?<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> — Rather, said Abaye, one carries on marital intercourse<br>in the usual manner and the Lord preserveth the simple.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: There are three partners in man, the Holy One, blessed be He, his father and<br>his mother. His father supplies the semen of the white substance out of which are formed the child's<br>bones, sinews, nails, the brain in his head and the white in his eye; his mother supplies the semen of<br>the red substance out of which is formed his skin, flesh, hair, blood<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> and the black of his eye; and<br>the Holy One, blessed be He, gives him the spirit and the breath,<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> beauty of features, eyesight, the<br>power of hearing<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> and the ability to speak<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> and to walk,<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> understanding and discernment. When<br>his time to depart from the world approaches the Holy One, blessed be He, takes away his share and<br>leaves the shares of his father and his mother with them. R. Papa observed: It is this that people have<br>in mind when they say, ‘Shake off the salt<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> and cast the flesh to the dog’.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup><br>R. Hinena b. Papa gave the following exposition: What is the purport of the Scriptural text, Who<br>doeth great things past finding out,’ yea, marvellous things without number?<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> Come and see the<br>contrast between the potency of the Holy One, blessed be He, and that of mortal man.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> A man might<br>put his things<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> in a skin bottle<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> [whose holes<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> are] tied up and whose orifice is turned upwards and<br>yet it is doubtful whether [the things] would be preserved or not, whereas the Holy One, blessed be<br>He, fashions the embryo in a woman's internal organ that is open and whose orifice is turned<br>downwards and yet it is preserved. Another exposition: If a man puts his things on the scale of a<br>balance, the heavier they are the lower the scale descends, whereas the Holy One, blessed be He,<br>[fashioned the woman in such a manner that] the heavier the embryo the higher it rises.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup><br>R. Jose the Galilean gave the following exposition: What is the purport of the Scriptural text, I<br>will give thanks unto Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; wonderful are Thy works; and<br>that my soul knoweth right well?<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> Come and see the contrast between the potency of the Holy One,<br>blessed be He, and that of mortal man.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> If a man<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> puts different seeds in a bed each grows in the<br>manner of its own particular species, whereas the Holy One, blessed be He, fashions the embryo in<br>the woman's bowels in such a manner that all<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> grow into one and the same kind. Another<br>exposition: If a dyer puts different ingredients into a boiler they all unite into one colour, whereas the<br>Holy One, blessed be He, fashions the embryo in a woman's bowels in a manner that each element<br>develops in its own natural way.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup><br>R. Joseph gave the following exposition: What is the purport of the Scriptural text, I will give<br>thanks unto Thee, O Lord; for though Thou wast angry with me, Thine anger is turned away, and<br>Thou comfortest me.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> The text alludes to<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> two men who set out on a trading expedition when a<br>thorn got into [the foot of] one of them who<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> began to blaspheme and to revile. After a time,<br>however, when he heard that his friend's ship had sunk into the sea he<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> began to laud and praise.<br>Hence it is written, ‘Thine anger is turned away, and Thou comfortest me’. This is indeed in line<br>with what R. Eleazar stated: What is implied by the Scriptural text, Who doeth wondrous things<br>alone;<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> and blessed be His glorious name for ever?<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> Even the person for whom a miracle is<br>performed<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> is unaware of the miracle.<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup><br>R. Hanina b. Papa made the following exposition: What is the implication of the Scriptural text,<br>Thou measurest my going about and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways?<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> It<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup><br>teaches that man is not fashioned from all the drop but only from its purest part. The school of R.<br>Ishmael taught: This is analogous to the action of one who, winnowing<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> in threshing floors, takes up<br>the edible part and leaves the refuse. This is in agreement with an exposition of R. Abbahu. For R.<br>Abbahu pointed out an incongruity: It is written, For Thou hast winnowed me from<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> strength<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> and<br>it is also written,<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> The God that girdeth me with strength!<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> David in effect said to the Holy One,<br>blessed be He, ‘Sovereign of the world, Thou hast winnowed me<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> and Thou hast girded me with<br>strength’.<br>R. Abbahu also gave this exposition: What is the implication of the Scriptural text, Who hath<br>counted the dust of Jacob, or numbered the stock of Israel?<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> It teaches that the Holy One, blessed be<br>He, sits and counts the stock of Israel. ‘When [He wonders] will appear the drop from which a<br>righteous man could be fashioned’? Moreover, it is for this reason that the eye of the wicked Balaam<br>was blinded. He said, ‘Would He who is pure and holy and whose ministers are pure and holy look<br>upon such a thing?’ His eye was forthwith blinded, for it is written, And the saying of the man whose<br>eye is closed.<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> This is in line with what R. Johanan stated: What is the implication of the Scriptural<br>text, And he lay with her in that night?<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> It teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, assisted in that<br>matter. For it is said, Issachar is a large-boned ass;<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> it is the ass<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> that has caused<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> the birth of<br>Issachar.<br>R. Isaac citing R. Ammi<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> stated: If the woman emits her semen first she bears a male child; if the<br>man emits his semen first she bears a female child; for it is said, If a woman emits semen<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> and bear<br>a man-child.<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: At first it used to be said that ‘if the woman emits her semen first she will bear<br>a male, and if the man emits his semen first she will bear a female’, but the Sages did not explain the<br>reason, until R. Zadok came and explained it: These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore unto Jacob<br>in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah,<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> Scripture thus ascribes the males to the females<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> and<br>the females to the males.<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup><br>And the sons of Ulam were mighty men of valour, archers; and had many sons, and sons’ sons.<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup><br>Now is it within the power of man to increase<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> the number of ‘sons and sons’ sons’?

Ammi further stated: As soon as a male comes into the world peace comes into<br>the world, for it is said, Send ye a gift<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> for the ruler of the land<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> [and the Hebrew for] male<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> [is<br>composed of the consonants of the ‘words for] ‘this is a gift’.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup><br>R.

Simeon b. Yohai was asked by his disciples: Why did the Torah ordain that a woman after<br>childbirth should bring a sacrifice? He replied: When she kneels in bearing she swears impetuously<br>that she will have no intercourse with her husband. The Torah, therefore, ordained that she should<br>bring a sacrifice. (R. Joseph demurred: Does she not<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> act presumptuously<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> in which case the<br>absolution of the oath<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> depends on her regretting it?<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> Furthermore, she should<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> have brought a<br>sacrifice prescribed for an oath!)<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> And why did the Torah ordain that in the case of a male [the<br>woman is clean] after seven days and in that of a female after fourteen days? [On the birth of a] male<br>with whom all rejoice she regrets her oath after seven days, [but on the birth of a female] about<br>whom everybody is upset she regrets her oath after fourteen days. And why did the Torah ordain<br>circumcision on the eighth day?<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> In order that the guests<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> shall not enjoy themselves<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> while his<br>father and mother are not in the mood for it.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> It was taught: R. Meir used to say, Why did the Torah<br>ordain that the uncleanness of menstruation should continue for seven days? Because being in<br>constant contact with his wife<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> [a husband might] develop a loathing towards her. The Torah,<br>therefore, ordained: Let her<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> be unclean for seven days<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> in order that<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> she shall be beloved by her<br>husband as at the time of her first entry into the bridal chamber.<br>R. Dostai son of R. Jannai was asked by his disciples: Why<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> does a man go in search of a woman<br>and no woman goes in search of a man? This is analogous to the case of a man who lost something.<br>Who goes in search of what? He who lost the thing goes in search of what he lost.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> And why does<br>the man lie face downwards and the woman face upwards towards the man? He [faces the elements]<br>from which he was created<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> and she [faces the man] from whom she was created.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> And why is a<br>man easily pacified and a woman is not easily pacified? He [derives his nature] from the place from<br>which he was created<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> and she [derives hers] from the place from which she was created.<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> Why is a<br>woman's voice sweet and a man's voice is not sweet? He [derives his] from the place from which he<br>was created<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> and she [derives hers] from the place from which she was created.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> Thus it is said,<br>For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup><br>C H A P T E R I V<br><b>MISHNAH</b>.

        "— It is R. Meir. For it was taught: A minor, whether male or female, may neither perform, nor<br>submit to halizah, nor contract levirate marriage; so R. Meir. They<sup>1</sup> said to R. Meir: You spoke well<br>when you ruled that they ‘may neither perform, nor submit to halizah’, since in the Pentateuchal<br>section<sup>2</sup> man<sup>3</sup> was written, and we draw a comparison between woman and man.<sup>4</sup> What, however, is<br>the reason why they may not contract levirate marriage? He replied: Because a minor male might be<br>found to be a saris;<sup>5</sup> a minor female might be found to be incapable of procreation;<sup>6</sup> and thus the law<br>of incest<sup>7</sup> would be violated where no religious act<sup>8</sup> is thereby performed. And the Rabbis?<sup>9</sup> —<br>Follow the majority of minor males and the majority of minors are no sarisim; follow the majority of<br>minor females, and the majority of minor females are not incapable of procreation.<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> Might it not be<br>suggested that R. Meir was heard [to take a minority into consideration only where that] minority is<br>frequent; was he, however, heard [to maintain his view in regard to] an infrequent minority? — This<br>also is a frequent minority, for it was taught: R. Jose stated, It happened at ‘En Bol<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> that the infant<br>was made to undergo ritual immersion<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> before her mother;<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> and Rabbi stated, It once happened at<br>Beth She'arim that the infant was made to undergo ritual immersion<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> before her mother;<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> and R.<br>Joseph stated, It once happened at Pumbeditha that the infant was made to undergo ritual<br>immersion<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> before her mother;<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> One can well understand the incidents spoken of by R. Joseph and<br>Rabbi<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> since [immersion was necessary as a protection for] the terumah<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> of Palestine; but why was<br>that necessary<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> in the case spoken of by R. Joseph,<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> seeing that Samuel had laid down: The<br>terumah of a country outside the Land of Israel is not forbidden unless [it came in contact] with a<br>person whose uncleanness emanated from his body,<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> and this applies only to eating but not to<br>contact?<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> — Mar Zutra replied: This<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> was required only in regard to anointing her with the oil of<br>terumah;<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> for it was taught: And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel,<br>which they set apart unto the Lord<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> includes<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> one who anoints oneself or drinks.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> But what need<br>was there for a Scriptural text [for inclusion in the prohibition of] one who drinks, seeing that<br>drinking is included in eating?<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> — Rather [say that the text<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> was intended] to include one who<br>anoints oneself [in the same prohibition] as one who drinks.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> And if you prefer I might reply, The<br>prohibition<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> is derived from here: And it is come into his inward parts like water, and like oil into<br>his bones.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> But if so<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> should not our daughters also [be unclean from their cradle]? — For us who<br>make a deduction of the use of ‘and if a woman’<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> instead of ‘a woman’ and [our daughters,] when<br>observing any discharge are kept away,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> the Rabbis enacted no preventive measure; but as regards<br>the Samaritans<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> who do not make any deduction from the use of ‘and if a woman’<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> instead of ‘a<br>woman’, and [their daughters] when observing any discharge are not kept away,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> the Rabbis<br>enacted the preventive measure. What is the exposition of ‘a woman’, ‘and if a woman’? — It was<br>taught: [If it had been written,]<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> ‘A woman’, I would only know that a woman [is subject to the<br>restrictions of menstrual uncleanness], whence could it be deduced that an infant one day old is also<br>subject to the restrictions of menstruation? Hence it was explicitly stated, ‘And if a woman’.<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> Thus<br>it is evident that in including a child Scripture included even one who is one day old. May not,<br>however, an incongruity be pointed out: [If Scripture had only written,]<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> ‘the woman’ I would only<br>know [that the restriction applies to] a woman, whence could it be derived that a child who is three<br>years and one day old [is equally under the restrictions] in respect of cohabition? Hence it was<br>explicitly stated, ‘The woman also’?<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> — Raba replied: These<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> are traditional laws but the Rabbis<br>tacked them on to Scriptural texts. Which one [can be deduced from] the Scriptural text and which is<br>only a traditional law?<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> If it be suggested that the law relating to an infant one day old is traditional<br>and that the one relating to such as is three years and one day old is deduced from a Scriptural text,is<br>not the text [it may be retorted] written in general terms?<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> — Rather say: The law relating to one<br>who is three years and one day old is traditional and the one derived from the text is that concerning<br>an infant who is one day old.

        "— To exclude a man from the uncleanness of a red discharge.<sup>1</sup> But consider the following<br>Baraitha:<sup>2</sup> From the term of ‘woman’<sup>3</sup> I would only infer that a woman [is subject to the restriction<br>of zibah], whence, however, could it be deduced that a female child that is ten days old<sup>4</sup> is also<br>subject to the restrictions of zibah? Hence it was explicitly stated, And if a woman.<sup>3</sup> Now, what need<br>was there for this text,<sup>5</sup> seeing that the law could have been inferred from that of menstruation?<sup>6</sup> —<br>It was necessary. For if the All Merciful had written the law in regard to a menstruant only it might<br>have been presumed that it applied only to the menstruant, since even if she observed a discharge on<br>one day only she must continue unclean for seven days, but not to a zabah for whom, if she observed<br>a discharge<sup>7</sup> on one day, it suffices to wait only one day corresponding to it;<sup>8</sup> hence the necessity for<br>the second text. Then why should not the All Merciful write the law in regard to a zabah and there<br>would be no need to give it again in regard to a menstruant, since one knows that there can be no<br>zabah unless she was previously a menstruant? — That is so indeed. Then what was the need for the<br>Scriptural text?<sup>9</sup> — To exclude a man from the uncleanness of a red discharge.<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> But was he not<br>already once excluded?<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> — One text serves to exclude him from the uncleanness of a discharge of<br>red semen and the other from that of blood.<br>The same law<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> applies also to males. For it was taught:<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> ‘A man, a man’,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> what need was there<br>for the repetition of ‘man’? To include a male child one day old who also is to be subject to the<br>uncleanness of zibah; so R. Judah. R. Ishmael son of R. Johanan b. Beroka said: This<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> is not<br>necessary, for, surely, Scripture says, Whether it be a man or a woman,<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> ‘whether it be a man’<br>implies any one who is man, whether adult or infant; ‘or a woman’ implies any one who is a female<br>irrespective of whether she is adult or minor. If so, why was it expressly stated, ‘a man, a man’?<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup><br>The Torah used an ordinary form of speech.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> Thus it is evident that in including a child Scripture<br>included even an infant one day old. Does not, however, an incongruity arise: [If Scripture had only<br>written]<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> ‘a man’ I would only know [that the law applied to] a man, whence could it be derived<br>that it also applies to a child who is nine years and one day old? Hence it was explicitly stated, And a<br>man?<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> — Raba replied: These<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> are traditional laws but the Rabbis found props for them in<br>Scriptural texts. Which one is only a traditional law and which can be deduced from the Scriptural<br>text? If it be suggested that the law relating to an infant one day old is traditional and that relating to<br>a child who is nine years and one day old is deduced from a Scriptural text, is not the text [it could<br>be objected] written in general terms?<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> — Rather say: The law relating to a child who is nine years<br>and one day old is traditional and the one relating to an infant one day old is derived from the<br>Scriptural text. But, since the former is a traditional law, what was the purpose of the Scriptural text?<br>— To exclude a woman from the uncleanness of a white discharge. What need was there for<br>Scripture to write [an additional word<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> and letter]<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> as regards males and females respectively?<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> —<br>These were necessary. For if the All Merciful had written the law in respect of males only it might<br>have been presumed that it applied to them alone since they become unclean by [three]<br>observations<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> [on the same day] as by [three observations on three successive] days,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> but not to<br>females who do not become unclean by [three] observations [on the same day] as by [three<br>observations on three successive] days. And if the All Merciful had written the law in respect of<br>females alone, it might have been presumed to apply to them only, since they become unclean even<br>if a discharge was due to a mishap but not to males who do not become unclean when a discharge is<br>due to a mishap.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> [The additional letters and words were, therefore,] necessary.<br>THE SAMARITANS IMPART UNCLEANNESS TO A COUCH UNDERNEATH AS TO A<br>COVER ABOVE, What is meant by A COUCH UNDERNEATH AS A COVER ABOVE? If it be<br>suggested to mean that if there were ten spreads<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> and he sat upon them they all become unclean, is<br>not this [it could be retorted] obvious seeing that he exercised pressure upon them?<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> — The<br>meaning rather is that a couch underneath one who had intercourse with a menstruant is subject to<br>the same law of uncleanness as the cover above a zab.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> As the cover above a zab imparts<br>uncleanness to foods and drinks only so does the couch underneath one who had intercourse with a<br>menstruant impart uncleanness to foods and drinks only. Whence is the law concerning the cover<br>above a zab deduced? — From the Scriptural text, And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under<br>him shall be unclean.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> For what could be the meaning of ‘under him’?<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Of semen (v. infra) which is similar in nature to the discharge dealt with in the text under discussion.

        "If it be suggested: Under the zab [it could be objected: This]<sup>1</sup> is derived from, And whosoever<br>toucheth his bed.<sup>2</sup> Consequently it must mean: Whosoever toucheth any thing under which the zab<br>was’;<sup>3</sup> and this is<sup>4</sup> the cover above the zab,<sup>5</sup> Scripture<sup>6</sup> segregated it from a grave uncleanness<sup>7</sup> and<br>transferred it to a lighter uncleanness in order to tell you that it imparts uncleanness to foods and<br>drinks only.<sup>8</sup> Might it not be suggested that Scripture segregated it from the grave uncleanness only<br>in order that it shall not impart uncleanness to a man<sup>9</sup> and thereby also impart uncleanness to his<br>clothes, but that it does impart uncleanness to a man<sup>9</sup> or to clothes?<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> — Scripture said: Shall be<br>unclean,<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> which implies<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> an uncleanness of a lighter character, And whence is the law concerning<br>the couch beneath one who had intercourse with a menstruant deduced? — From what was taught:<br>And her impurity be upon him.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> As it might have been presumed that he is released from his<br>uncleanness as soon as he is released,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> it was explicitly stated, He shall be unclean seven days.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup><br>Then why was it explicitly stated, ‘And her impurity be upon him’? As it might have been presumed<br>that he imparts no uncleanness to man or earthenware, it was explicitly stated, ‘And her impurity be<br>upon him’,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> as she imparts uncleanness to man<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> and to earthenware<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> so does he impart<br>uncleanness to man<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> and earthenware.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> In case it might be suggested:<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> As she causes a couch or a<br>seat to become unclean so as to impart uncleanness to a man and thereby also impart uncleanness to<br>his clothes, so does he also cause his couch and seat to impart uncleanness to man and thereby<br>impart uncleanness to his clothes, it was explicitly stated: And every bed whereon he lieth shall be<br>unclean.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> For<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> it should not have been stated. ‘and every bed on which he lieth shall be unclean’,<br>then why was it written, ‘And every bed on which etc.’? Scripture has, thereby, segregated it from a<br>grave uncleanness<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> and transferred it to a lighter uncleanness, to tell you that it imparts uncleanness<br>to foods and drinks only. R. Ahai demurred: Might it not be suggested that Scripture had segregated<br>it from a grave uncleanness and transferred it to a lighter uncleanness only in order that it shall not<br>impart uncleanness to a man and thereby also convey it to his clothes, but that it does impart<br>uncleanness to a man<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> or to clothes?<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> — R. Assi replied: Shall be unclean<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> implies<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> an<br>uncleanness of a lighter nature. Might it not be argued: ‘And her impurity be upon him’<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> is a<br>generalization, ‘and every bed’<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> is a specification<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> and, since the scope of a generalization when<br>followed by a specialization already comprehended in it is limited by the thing specified, only<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> a<br>bed and a seat, but no other thing should convey uncleanness? — Abaye replied: ‘He shall be<br>unclean for seven days’<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> makes a break in the context, so that this is a case of a generalization and a<br>specification that are distant from one another and whenever a generalization and a specification are<br>distant from one another the rule of generalization and specification does not apply. Raba replied:<br>The rule<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> in fact does apply, but the expression of ‘and every’<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> is an extension.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> R. Jacob<br>demurred: Might it not be argued that he<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> is<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> subject to the same uncleanness as she in this respect:<br>As in her case no distinction is made between her touch and her bed as regards the conveyance of<br>uncleanness to a person and to his clothes, thus adopting the stricter course,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> so also in his case no<br>distinction should be made between his touch and his bed as regards the conveyance of uncleanness<br>to a person and to his clothes, the lenient course being adopted?<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> — Raba replied:<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> ‘Upon him’<br>implies: To put a load upon him.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup><br>SINCE THEY COHABIT WITH MENSTRUANTS etc. Do they all<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> cohabit with menstruants?<br>— R. Isaac of Magdala replied: This was learnt about married persons only.<br>BECAUSE [THEIR WIVES] CONTINUE [UNCLEAN FOR SEVEN DAYS] ON ACCOUNT<br>OF A DISCHARGE OF ANY BLOOD etc. It was taught: R. Meir stated, If they continue [unclean<br>for seven days] on account of a discharge of any blood,<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> is not this<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> rather an important safeguard<br>for them? But the fact is that when they observe a discharge of red blood they treat it as<br>supplementary to a previous discharge of yellow blood.<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> Another explanation: She includes the day<br>on which her discharge ceases<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> in the number of the seven days.<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> Rami b. Hama demurred: Why<br>indeed should she not count it,<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> and why should not we also count it,<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> seeing that we have an<br>established rule that part of a day is regarded as the whole of it? — Raba retorted: If so,<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> how could<br>it be possible for an emission of semen to cause the counting<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> after a zibah to be void seeing that a<br>part of the day is to be counted as the whole of it?<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> If one had observed the discharge in the middle<br>of the day the law might indeed be so,<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> but here we might be dealing with one who observed the<br>discharge near sunset?<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> — Could it then definitely be assumed that<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> the Scriptural text was written<br>only [in regard to a discharge] near sunset? — Yes; you must indeed allow the text to be so<br>explained, for it<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> forces this interpretation upon itself.<br>Rami b. Hama enquired: If a woman<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> ejected some semen;<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> does she cause her counting<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> after a<br>zibah to be void?

        "or is she rather regarded as one who merely touched it and, therefore, she does not cause the<br>counting to be void? — Raba replied, His error is as deep as his subtlety: Granted that she causes her<br>counting to be void, how many days could be affected?

HOWEVER, NO OBLIGATION IS<br>INCURRED FOR ENTRANCE INTO THE TEMPLE etc. R. Papa once visited Tuak<sup>8</sup> when he<br>remarked, ‘If there lives a scholar in this place I would go and pay him my respects’.<sup>9</sup> ‘A scholar<br>lives here’, said an old woman to him, ‘and his name is R. Samuel and he learns Tannaitic traditions.<br>May it be God's will that you be like him’. ‘Since’,he thought. ‘she blesses me by him I can gather<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup><br>that he is a God<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> -fearing man’. He thereupon visited him when the latter treated him to<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> a bull;<br>and he also treated him to an incongruity<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> between Tannaitic teachings: We have learnt, ON<br>ACCOUNT OF THEIR [UNCLEANNESS]. HOWEVER, NO OBLIGATION IS INCURRED FOR<br>ENTRANCE INTO THE TEMPLE NOR IS TERUMAH BURNT ON THEIR ACCOUNT, SINCE<br>THEIR<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> UNCLEANNESS IS ONLY OF A DOUBTFUL NATURE, from which it is evident that<br>terumah is not burnt in a case of doubt. But have we not learnt to the contrary: In six doubtful cases<br>of uncleanness is terumah burnt [and one of them is] the doubtful uncleanness of the clothes of an<br>‘am ha-arez?<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> — ‘May it be God's will’, exclaimed R. Papa, ‘that this bull shall be eaten in peace:<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup><br>Here<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> we are dealing with the case of a Samaritan who was a haber’.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> ‘But would you presume<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup><br>[the other retorted] that a Samaritan who is a haber had intercourse with a menstruant?’ When he left<br>him<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> and came to R. Shimi b. Ashi the latter said to him: Why did you not answer him [that our<br><b>MISHNAH</b><sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> deals] with the case of a Samaritan who, having performed ritual immersion, came up and<br>trod upon the clothes<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> of a haber and the clothes<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> of this haber then came in contact with<br>terumah,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> so that if [the terumah were to be treated as unclean] on account of the uncleanness of the<br>‘am ha-arez [it could be objected]: He has, surely, performed ritual immersion.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> And if the<br>uncleanness were to be attributed to his likely intercourse with a menstruant [it could be objected]: It<br>is doubtful whether he had his intercourse recently or some time ago.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> And even if you were to find<br>some ground for assuming that his intercourse took place recently there is still the doubt whether she<br>had completed her period of cleanness for yellow blood or not.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> This then is a case of double<br>doubt,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> and no terumah may be burnt on account of a doubly doubtful uncleanness. But why should<br>not the uncleanness of the terumah be established<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> on account of its contact with the clothes of an<br>‘am ha-arez, a Master having stated: The clothes of an ‘am ha-arez are like midras uncleanness<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> to<br>Pharisees?<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> — The other replied: This is a case of a naked Samaritan.<br><b>MISHNAH</b>. THE DAUGHTERS OF THE SADDUCEES, SO LONG AS THEY ARE IN THE<br>HABIT OF WALKING IN THE PATHS OF THEIR FATHERS, ARE TO BE REGARDED AS<br>SAMARITAN WOMEN, IF THEY LEFT THOSE PATHS<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> TO ‘WALK IN THE PATHS OF<br>ISRAEL. THEY ARE TO BE REGARDED AS ISRAELITISH WOMEN. R. JOSE RULED: THEY<br>ARE ALWAYS REGARDED AS ISRAELITISH WOMEN UNLESS THEY LEAVE THE PATHS<br>OF ISRAEL TO WALK IN THE PATHS OF THEIR FATHERS.<br><b>GEMARA</b>. The question was raised: What is the law<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> where their attitude is unknown?<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> —<br>Come and hear: THE DAUGHTERS OF THE SADDUCEES, SO LONG AS THEY ARE IN THE<br>HABIT OF WALKING IN THE PATHS OF THEIR FATHERS, ARE TO BE REGARDED AS<br>SAMARITAN WOMEN; from which it follows that if their attitude is unknown they are like<br>Israelitish women. Read then the final clause: IF THEY LEFT THESE PATHS TO WALK IN THE<br>PATHS OF ISRAEL, THEY ARE TO BE REGARDED AS ISRAELITISH WOMEN; from which it<br>follows that if their attitude is unknown they are like Samaritan women! But the fact is that no<br>inference may be drawn from this [Mishnah].<br>Come and hear what we have learnt: R. JOSE RULED, THEY ARE ALWAYS REGARDED AS<br>ISRAELITISH WOMEN UNLESS THEY LEAVE THE PATHS OF ISRAEL TO WALK IN THE<br>PATHS OF THEIR FATHERS. Thus it follows that the first Tanna<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> holds that when their attitude is<br>unknown they are to be regarded as Samaritan women. This is conclusive.<br>Our Rabbis taught: It once happened that a Sadducee was conversing with a High Priest in the<br>market place when some spittle was squirted from his mouth and fell on the clothes of the High<br>Priest. The face of the High Priest<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> turned yellow and he hurried to his<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> wife<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> who assured him<br>that although they were wives of Sadducees they paid homage to the Pharisees and showed their<br>blood to the Sages.<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> R. Jose observed: We<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> know them better than anybody else [and can testify]<br>that they show their menstrual blood to the Sages. There was only one exception, a woman who<br>lived in our neighbourhood who did not show her blood to the Sages but she died. But why was he<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup><br>not concerned about the uncleanness<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> that is occasioned by the spittle of an ‘am ha-arez?<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> —<br>Abaye replied: This was a case of a Sadducee who was a haber.<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> Said Raba: Is a Sadducee who is a<br>haber presumed<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> to have intercourse with a menstruant? Rather, said Raba:<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) If a man who was a zab emitted semen on one of the seven clean days following a zibah he loses that day only.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Lev, XV, <sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Even that of one day.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Lev.

        "even in the bowels of an idolatress,<sup>1</sup> while that of an idolater is clean everywhere, even in the bowels<br>of an Israelitish woman, with the exception of any urine of hers that is mixed up with it.<sup>2</sup> And should<br>you argue that here also it is only Pentateuchally clean but unclean Rabbinically, [it could be<br>retorted:] Does then her urine convey uncleanness Pentateuchally?<sup>3</sup> Consequently it may be inferred<br>that it<sup>4</sup> is clean even Rabbinically. This is conclusive.<br>The Master said, ‘The semen of an Israelite is unclean everywhere, even in the bowels of an<br>idolatress’. May you not thereby solve a question of R. Papa; for R. Papa enquired. ‘What is the law<br>regarding the semen of an Israelite in the bowels of an idolatress?’ [Concerning a discharge] within<br>three days<sup>5</sup> R. Papa raised no questions. His enquiry related only to one after three days.<sup>6</sup> What, he<br>asked, is the law? Is it only in the case of Israelites, who are anxious to observe the commandments,<br>that their bodies engender heat and the semen decomposes<sup>7</sup> but in the case of idolaters, who are not<br>anxious to observe the commandments, their bodies engender no heat and their [semen] therefore<br>does not decompose, or is it possible that on account of their consumption of forbidden animals and<br>reptiles their bodies also engender heat and their semen also decomposes? — This remains<br>undecided.<br>THE CLEAN BLOOD OF A LEPROUS WOMAN, BETH SHAMMAI etc. What is Beth Hillel's<br>reason? — R. Isaac replied: ‘Whether it be a man’<sup>8</sup> includes<sup>9</sup> a male leper as regards his sources;<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup><br>‘or a woman’<sup>8</sup> includes<sup>9</sup> a female leper as regards her sources. Now what could be meant by ‘her<br>sources’? If it be suggested: Her other sources<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> [the objection could be made that the uncleanness of<br>these] could be inferred from that of the male.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> The reference consequently must be to [the<br>uncleanness of] her blood,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> to declare her ‘CLEAN BLOOD’ unclean. And Beth Shammai?<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> —<br>[The uncleanness of] a female could not be deduced from that of a male, for it can be objected: The<br>position of the male is different<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> since he is also required<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> to uncover his head and to rend his<br>clothes<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> and he is also forbidden cohabitation; [how then could his uncleanness] be compared to<br>that of a female<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> who is not [subject to his restrictions]?<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> And Beth Hillel?<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> — The All Merciful<br>could have written down the restrictions in regard to the female and there would have been no need<br>to repeat them in regard to the male; for it could have been argued: If in the case of a female,<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> who<br>is not required to uncover her head or to rend her clothes and who is not forbidden cohabitation<br>either, the All Merciful included her sources<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> how much more then should this be the rule<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> in the<br>case of the male.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> Now since the text serves no purpose in regard to the male,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> apply it to the<br>female; and since it can serve no purpose as far as her other sources<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> are concerned,<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> apply it to her<br>blood, to declare her ‘CLEAN BLOOD’ unclean. And Beth Shammai?<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> — The uncleanness of a<br>male cannot be deduced from that of a female, for it can be objected: The position of a female is<br>different,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> since she becomes unclean<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> even as a result of a mishap; [how then could her<br>uncleanness] be compared to that of a male who is not [subject to such a restriction]? And Beth<br>Hillel?<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> — The subject dealt with is the position of<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> the leper, how can they raise an objection<br>against it from that of the zab?<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> And Beth Shammai?<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> — They raise objections from any form of<br>uncleanness. And if you prefer I might reply that Beth Shammai can answer you: The expression<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup><br>‘whether it be a man’<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> is required for the following exposition: ‘Whether it be a man’ whosoever is<br>a man irrespective of whether he is of age or only a minor.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> And Beth Hillel?<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> — They derive this<br>ruling from ‘This is the law of him that hath an issue’<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> which implies, whether he be of age or a<br>minor.<br>R. Joseph stated: When R. Simeon b. Lakish discoursed on the zab he raised the following<br>question.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> Does the first observation<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> of a zab who was a minor convey uncleanness by contact?<br>The All Merciful having said, This is the law of him that hath an issue and of him from whom the<br>flow of seed goeth out,<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> therefore only if his ‘flow of seed’ causes uncleanness does his first<br>observation also cause uncleanness, but the minor,<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> since his ‘flow of seed’ conveys no<br>uncleanness, his first observation also conveys no uncleanness; or is it possible that it is unclean,<br>since if he observed two discharges the two are combined?<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> — Raba replied. Come and hear: This<br>is the law of him that have an issue,<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> implies, whether he is of age or a minor; as in the case of an<br>adult a first observation conveys uncleanness so also in that of a minor a first observation conveys<br>uncleanness.<br>R. Joseph enquired: Does the blood of a first observation of a leper convey uncleanness by<br>contact? Is the place of the zibah a source and, therefore, conveys uncleanness,<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> or is it possible that<br>it is no source and, therefore, conveys no uncleanness?<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> — Raba replied, Come and hear: His issue<br>is unclean,<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> this teaches concerning an issue of a zab that it is unclean.<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> Now of what kind of<br>person has this been said? If it be suggested: Of one who is only a zab<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup><br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) If she discharged it on a garment.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) As the idolater's semen is here ruled to be clean everywhere, support is adduced for Raba's ruling.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Of course not.

        "[the difficulty would arise:] If it<sup>1</sup> causes the uncleanness of others,<sup>2</sup> is it not obvious that it causes<br>that of the man himself?<sup>3</sup> It is consequently obvious that this has been said of a zab who is a leper.<sup>4</sup><br>And since a Scriptural text was required to include him in the category of uncleanness after a second<br>observation,<sup>5</sup> it may be inferred that the place of the zibah is no source.<sup>6</sup> Said Rab Judah of Diskarta<sup>7</sup><br>to Raba: What is the proof?<sup>8</sup> Is it not still possible to maintain that the text deals with one who is<br>only a zab;<sup>9</sup> and as to your objection ‘If it causes the uncleanness of others, is it not obvious that it<br>causes that of the man himself?’ [It can be retorted:] The case of the scapegoat<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> proves [the<br>invalidity of your argument], for it causes uncleanness to others<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> while it is itself clean.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> Abaye<br>observed: Why did he<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> at all raise such a question, seeing that he himself stated, ‘This is the law of<br>him that hath an issue,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> implies, whether he is of age or a minor’, and since this law<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> has been<br>deduced by him from that text,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> the expression of ‘whether it be a man’<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> remains free for the<br>purpose of including a leper in regard to his source and ‘or a woman’ serves to include a female<br>leper in regard to her sources; and the All Merciful has compared<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> the leper to the confirmed zab:<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup><br>As the confirmed zab conveys uncleanness through carriage so does the first discharge of a leper<br>convey uncleanness by carriage.<br>R. Huna ruled: The first observed discharge of a zab conveys uncleanness<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> even in the case of a<br>mishap; for it is said, This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him from whom the flow of<br>seed goeth out;<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> as ‘the flow of seed’ conveys uncleanness even in the case of a mishap so does the<br>first observed discharge of a zab convey uncleanness even in the case of a mishap. Come and hear: If<br>he observed a first discharge, he must be examined.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> Is not this done to determine his<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup><br>uncleanness?<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> — No; in regard to a sacrifice.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> Come and hear: At the second observation of a<br>discharge he must be examined.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> Now for what purpose? If it be suggested: For that of a sacrifice<br>but not for that of uncleanness<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> [it could be retorted:] Apply here the Scriptural text ‘out of his<br>flesh’.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> which implies, but not as a result of a mishap.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> Consequently it must be for the purpose of<br>uncleanness. And since the final clause refers to an examination in regard to uncleanness must not<br>the first clause also refer to one for uncleanness?<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> — What an argument! Each might refer to an<br>examination for different purposes.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> Come and hear: R. Eliezer ruled: Even at the third observation<br>he must be examined on account of the sacrifice.’ From which it follows, does it not, that the first<br>Tanna requires it<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> on account of the uncleanness?<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> — No; all may require it<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> on account of the<br>sacrifice, but here they<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> differ on the exposition of the eth<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> particles. The Rabbis base no<br>exposition on the eth particles and R. Eliezer does. ‘The Rabbis base no exposition on the eth<br>particles’: ‘He that hath an issue’<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> represents one discharge, ‘his issue’<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> represents a second one;<br>so far ‘for the man’;<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> while at the third discharge the All Merciful compared him to the woman.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup><br>‘And R.

        "in that he causes a couch and a seat to be unclean.<sup>1</sup> Now when [does this ruling apply]? If it be<br>suggested: When a second discharge was observed [the objection would arise]: How could he then<br>be included in ‘the same law of uncleanness as one who emitted semen’?

But the fact is that it is<br>this that was meant: ‘R. Isaac said, A zab after his first observation was surely included in the same<br>law of uncleanness as one who emitted semen, why then was he in the case of a second observation<br>excluded? In order to relax the law for him in one respect and to restrict it for him in another respect.<br>\"To relax the law for him\" in that he does not become unclean in case of a mishap; \"and to restrict it<br>for him\" in that he causes a couch and a bed to be unclean’.<sup>5</sup><br>R. Huna stated: The discharge of a zab resembles the dough water of barley. The discharge of the<br>zab issues from dead flesh while semen issues from live flesh. The former is watery and resembles<br>the white of a crushed egg while the latter is viscous and resembles the white of a sound egg.<br>THE BLOOD OF A WOMAN AFTER CHILDBIRTH WHO DID NOT UNDERGO RITUAL<br>IMMERSION etc. It was taught: Beth Hillel said to Beth Shammai, Do you not agree that if a<br>menstruant who did not undergo ritual Immersion observed some blood she is unclean?<sup>6</sup> Said Beth<br>Shammai to them: [This is] no [comparison]. If you apply this law<sup>7</sup> to a menstruant who, even after<br>she had undergone immersion, is unclean if she observed a discharge, would you also apply it to a<br>woman after childbirth who, if she had undergone immersion and then observed a discharge, is<br>clean? The former retorted: The case of one who gave birth during zibah proves our case; for if such<br>a woman had undergone ritual immersion<sup>8</sup> and observed a discharge after the counted days she is<br>clean<sup>9</sup> while if she did not undergo immersion and observed a discharge she is unclean. The latter<br>replied: The same law<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> applies,<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> and this is our reply. This then implies that they<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> are in<br>disagreement.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> But have we not learnt: THEY<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> AGREE, HOWEVER, THAT IF SHE GAVE<br>BIRTH WHILE IN ZIBAH, IT CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS BOTH WHEN WET AND WHEN<br>DRY? — This is no difficulty, since the latter<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> refers to one who already counted the prescribed<br>days while the former<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> refers to one who did not count them.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> And so it was also taught: If a<br>woman who gave birth during zibah had counted the prescribed number of clean days but did not<br>undergo ritual immersion and then observed a discharge. Beth Shammai gave their ruling<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> in<br>accordance with their own view<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> and Beth Hillel ruled in accordance with their own view.<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup><br>It was stated: Rab said, [the blood discharge<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> emanates<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> from] one and the same source; but it is<br>the Torah that declared it unclean during one period<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> and clean during another.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> Levi, however,<br>said, It emanates from two different sources. When the unclean one is closed<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> the clean one opens,<br>and when the clean one closes,<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> the unclean one opens. What is the practical difference between<br>them?<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> — The practical difference between them is the case of a continuous discharge from within<br>the seven days into the period following these seven days, or from within the fourteen days into the<br>period after the fourteenth, or from within the forty days to the period after the forty days or from<br>within the eighty days into the period following eighty days. According to Rab the law is to be<br>relaxed in the first case<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> and restricted in the latter;<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> but according to Levi the law is to be<br>restricted in the first case<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> and relaxed in the latter.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup><br>An objection was raised: THE BLOOD OF A WOMAN AFTER CHILDBIRTH WHO DID NOT<br>UNDERGO RITUAL IMMERSION, BETH SHAMMAI RULED, IS LIKE HER SPITTLE AND<br>HER URINE, BUT BETH HILLEL RULED: IT CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS BOTH WHEN WET<br>AND WHEN DRY, It was now presumed that this is a case where<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> there was a break.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> This then is<br>satisfactory according to Rab who said that the discharge emanates from one and the same source,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup><br>for this reason it conveys uncleanness both when wet and dry.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> But according to Levi who said that<br>it emanated from two different sources why<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> should it convey uncleanness both when wet and when<br>dry? — Levi can answer you: We are here dealing with the case of a woman whose discharge was<br>continuous.<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> But if the discharge was continuous, what is Beth Shammai's reason? — Beth<br>Shammai are of the opinion that there exists only once source. According to Levi<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> one can quite<br>well see the point that divides Beth Shammai from Beth Hillel;<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> but, according to Rab,<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> what<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> is<br>the point that divides them?<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> — The point that divides them in the question whether<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> both the<br>termination of the prescribed number of days and also ritual immersion are required; Beth Shammai<br>holding that the All Merciful made the cleanness dependent on the days alone while Beth Hillel hold<br>that<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> it is dependent on both the days and immersion.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup><br>Come and hear: THEY AGREE, HOWEVER, THAT IF SHE GAVE BIRTH WHILE IN ZIBAH,<br>IT CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS BOTH WHEN WET AND WHEN DRY. It was now assumed that<br>here also<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> it is a case where there was a break.<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> Now, according to Rab who stated that there exists<br>only one source one can quite well see the reason why the discharge conveys UNCLEANNESS<br>BOTH WHEN WET AND WHEN DRY;<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> but according to Levi who stated that the sources are two<br>why does the discharge<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> CONVEY UNCLEANNESS BOTH WHEN WET AND WHEN DRY?<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup><br>— He can answer you: Here also it is a case of a continuous discharge. But if the discharge was<br>continuous, what was the need of stating the law?<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> — It was necessary to state it for the sake of<br>Beth Shammai: Although Beth Shammai maintain that there is only one source and that the All<br>Merciful had ordained the uncleanness to be dependent entirely on the lapse of the prescribed<br>number of days,<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> this applies only to a woman in normal<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> childbirth, the prescribed number of<br>whose unclean days had passed,<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> but not to a woman who gave birth in zibah who is required also<br>to count seven clean days.<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup><br>Come and hear: Her sickness shall be unclean<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> includes<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> the man who had intercourse with<br>her;<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> ‘her sickness shall be unclean’<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> includes<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> the nights;<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> ‘her sickness shall she be unclean’<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup><br>includes<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> a woman who gave birth while in zibah who remains in her uncleanness<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> until seven<br>clean days have passed.<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> This<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> is quite intelligible according to Rab who said that there exists only<br>one source, since it is for this reason that she<sup>6</sup><sup>4</sup> requires seven clean days,<sup>6</sup><sup>5</sup><br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) As a ‘father of uncleanness’.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) When (cf. supra <sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>b ad fin.) he may well be compared to one who emitted semen.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) An objection against R.

        "but according to Levi, who said that the sources were two, why should it be necessary to count seven<br>days, seeing that the slightest [break]<sup>1</sup> should suffice?<sup>2</sup> — It is this that was meant: It is necessary for<br>her that<sup>3</sup> there shall be a slight [break]<sup>4</sup> in order that [the following days] shall be counted as her<br>seven clean ones.<br>Come and hear: The days of her pregnancy supplement those of her nursing,<sup>5</sup> and the days of her<br>nursing supplement those of her pregnancy. In what manner? If there was a break of two ‘onahs<br>during her pregnancy and of one during her nursing, or of two during her nursing and of one during<br>her pregnancy, or of one and a half during her pregnancy and of one and a half during her nursing,<br>they are all combined into a series of three ‘onahs.<sup>6</sup> Now according to Rab who said that there was<br>only one source this ruling is quite justified, for it is for this reason<sup>7</sup> that there must be a break of<br>three ‘onahs,<sup>8</sup> but according to Levi who said that there were two sources why<sup>9</sup> should a break of<br>three ‘onahs be required, seeing that the slightest [break] should suffice?<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> — It is this that was<br>meant: It is necessary for her that there shall be a slight [break] in order that [the following days]<br>shall be counted for her<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> as three ‘onahs.<br>Come and hear: Both,<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> however, are of the same opinion that where a woman observed a<br>discharge after her clean blood period<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> it suffices for her to reckon her uncleanness from the time of<br>her observation. Now according to Levi who said that there exist two sources one may well concede<br>this ruling since it is for this reason<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> that<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> it suffices for her to reckon her uncleanness from the<br>time of her observation,<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> but according to Rab who said that there existed only one source, why<br>should it suffice for her to reckon her uncleanness from the time of her observation seeing that<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> she<br>should have become unclean for twenty-four hours retrospectively? — This is a case where there<br>was not time enough.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> But why should she not be unclean from her previous examination to her last<br>examination?<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> — As there was no interval of twenty-four hours<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> the Rabbis enacted no preventive<br>measure even in regard to uncleanness from the previous examination to the last examination.<br>Come and hear: If a woman who was in childbirth during zibah had counted the prescribed<br>number of clean days but did not undergo ritual immersion, and then observed a discharge, Beth<br>Shammai gave their ruling in accordance with their own view and Beth Hillel ruled in accordance<br>with their own view.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> Now according to Rab who said that there was only one source this ruling is<br>quite justified, since it is for this reason<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> that<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> the discharge causes uncleanness both when wet and<br>when dry; but according to Levi who said that there were two sources, why<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> does the discharge<br>cause uncleanness both when wet and when dry? — Levi can answer you: I maintain the same view<br>as the Tanna who stated that ‘both, however, are of the same opinion’.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> And if you prefer I might<br>reply that here we are dealing with one whose discharge is continuous. But was it not stated that she<br>had counted?<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> — Here we are dealing with one who gave birth to a female child while in zibah and<br>whose discharge ceased during the first week<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> but continued again<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> in the second week,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> he being<br>of the opinion that the unclean days of childbirth in which no discharge is observed are counted<br>among the clean days of one's zibah.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> Rabina said to R. Ashi: R. Shamen of Sikara<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> told us, ‘Mar<br>Zutra once visited our place when he delivered a discourse In which he laid down: The law is to be<br>restricted in agreement with Rab<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> and it is also to be restricted in agreement with Levi’.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> R. Ashi<br>stated: The law is in agreement with Rab both in his relaxations<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> and his restrictions.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> Meremar in<br>his discourse laid down: The law is in agreement with Rab both in his relaxations<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> and<br>restrictions.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> And the law is in agreement with Rab both in his relaxations<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> and restrictions.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup><br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) At the termination of the unclean period.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) For the closing up of the unclean source. As all the blood that is discharged subsequently emanates from the clean<br>source it should suffice for the woman to wait after the unclean period no more than seven days and attain cleanness at<br>their termination, irrespective of whether she observed any discharge during these days or not.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) At the termination of the unclean period.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) An indication that the unclean source had been closed.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) As regards the establishment of a regular period.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Supra <sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>b q.v. notes.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) That there is only one source.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) In the absence of such a break the discharge cannot be regarded as having ceased.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Since the blood after the unclean period emanates from the clean source, while the unclean one is closed.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Cf. supra p. <sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup>. n. <sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> mut. mut.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Even if she observed a discharge.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Shammai and Hillel who differ on the question of twenty-four hours retrospective uncleanness.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) This is now presumed to mean even if a considerable time after, on the eighty-third or ninetieth day after child-birth,<br>for instance.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) That there exist two sources.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) The blood from the unclean source having ceased for many days.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Which (cf. prev. n.) is rightly regarded as a first discharge after many days from the unclean source. A first<br>discharge in the case of a nursing-woman, as in that of another three categories of woman, does not cause any<br>retrospective uncleanness.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Since that source has also been discharging during the clean period and the present discharge cannot be regarded as<br>a first one.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Sc. less than a twenty-four hours interval has elapsed between the end of the clean period and the observation of the<br>discharge. Hence even if the blood discharged had been in the outer chamber twenty-four hours previously the woman<br>(since her blood at that time was still clean) could not be deemed unclean.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) If, for instance, on examining herself in the morning she observed a discharge, her uncleanness should be<br>retrospective and all objects she handled during the night should be regarded as unclean. The previous answer that ‘there<br>was not time enough’ cannot be given here, since in such a case there would have been no necessity whatsoever to state,<br>what is so obvious, that in such a case it suffices to reckon the uncleanness from the time of observation.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Cf. prev. n. but one.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) That before ritual immersion the discharge is unclean both when wet and when dry.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) That there existed only one source.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) In the absence of ritual immersion.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Seeing that the required number of days had been counted and the unclean source must have been stopped.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) That if there was a discharge after the termination of the clean blood period, even though (as explained supra) more<br>than twenty-four hours intervened, it suffices for the woman to be unclean from the time she observed a discharge;<br>which shows that he also holds that there exist two sources.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) It does. Now, if the flow of blood had not ceased, how could she even begin to count?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) Of the two unclean weeks prescribed for a woman after the birth of a female.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) Lit., ‘did not cease’, ‘break off’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) Hence the statement that ‘she had counted’. As in the second week, however, the discharge began again and<br>continued into the third week, it conveys uncleanness, according to Beth Hillel, both when wet and when dry, since it<br>emanates from an unclean source which the Torah did not regard as clean before the prescribed number of days had been<br>counted and immersion had been performed.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) On the Tigris near Mahoza.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) That if the discharge was continuous from within the clean period into the unclean one following, it conveys<br>uncleanness as if it had emanated from an unclean source.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) That where a discharge continued from within the clean days period into the clean one that follows, it is not<br>regarded as clean blood since the continuous discharge is an indication that the unclean source had not yet closed up.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) That where the discharge continued from within the unclean period into the clean one following, it is regarded as<br>clean after the last unclean day, despite its continuity.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) This is explained in the Gemara infra.",

Joshua's brother<br>ruled: Provided her pains of labour were experienced<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> on her third day.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> even though she had relief<br>during the rest of that day, she<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> is not regarded as having given birth in zibah. What does the<br>expression ‘The general rule’ include? — It includes the ruling of Hananiah.<br>Whence is this<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> deduced? — Our<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> Rabbis taught: Her blood<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> refers to blood that is normally<br>discharged,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> but not to such as is due to childbirth.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> You say. ‘[Not to such as is] due to childbirth’;<br>is it not possible that only that blood is excluded<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> which is due to an accident?<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> As it was said, And<br>if a woman have an issue of her blood,<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> a discharge that is due to an accident is included;<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> to what<br>then could one apply the limitation of ‘her blood’?<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> Obviously to this: \"Her blood\" refers to blood<br>that is normally discharged but not to such as is due to childbirth’. But<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> what reason do you see for<br>holding the blood of childbirth clean and that which is due to an accident unclean? I hold that which<br>is due to childbirth clean since it is followed by cleanness,<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> but hold that which is due to an accident<br>unclean since it is not followed by cleanness. On the contrary! That which is due to an accident<br>should be held clean since a discharge from a zab that is due to an accident is clean? — Now at all<br>events we are dealing with the case of a woman, and we do not find that in the case of a woman<br>blood due to an accident is ever clean. And if you prefer I might reply: What opinion do you hold? Is<br>it to regard a discharge that is due to an accident clean and one that is due to childbirth unclean?<br>Surely you cannot point to any occurrence that is more in the nature of an accident<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> than this.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> If<br>so,<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> why should it not be said in the case of a menstruant also: Her issue<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> refers to an issue that is<br>normally discharged but not to such as is due to childbirth?<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> You say, ‘[not to such as is due to]<br>childbirth’; is it not possible that only that blood is excluded<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> which is due to an accident?<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> As it<br>was said, And if a woman have an issue,<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> a discharge that is due to an accident is included;<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> to<br>what then could one apply the limitation of ‘her issue’?<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> Obviously to this: ‘Her issue’ refers to an<br>issue that is normally discharged but not to such as is due to childbirth!<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> — Resh Lakish answered:<br>Scripture said, She shall continue<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> which implies:<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> You have another continuation which is of the<br>same nature as this one;<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> and which is it?<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> It is that of protracted labour during the days of her<br>zibah. Might it not be suggested that this refers to protracted labour during the days of her<br>menstruation? — Rather, said Samuel's father, Scripture said, Then she shall be unclean two weeks,<br>as in her menstruation,<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> [implying] but not ‘as in her zibah’, from which it may be inferred that her<br>zibah is clean; and which is it?<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> It is that of protracted labour during the days of her zibah. Now,<br>however, that it is written, Then she shall be unclean two weeks as in her menstruation,<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> what need<br>was there for the expression of ‘her blood’?<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> — If not for the expression ‘her blood’ it might have<br>been presumed that the deduction ‘as in her menstration’<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> and not ‘as in her zibah’ implies that the<br>discharge is clean even where the woman was relieved from pain,<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> hence we were informed<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> [that<br>the discharge is clean only where it is due to childbirth].<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup><br>Shila b. Abina gave a practical decision in agreement with the view of Rab.<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> When Rab's soul<br>was about to depart to its eternal rest he<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> said to R. Assi, ‘Go and restrain him,<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> and if he does not<br>listen to you try to convince him’.<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> The other thought that he was told, ‘put him under the ban’.<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup><br>After Rab's soul came to its eternal rest he<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> said to him,<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> ‘Retract, for Rab has retracted’. ‘If’, the<br>other retorted, ‘he had retracted he would have told me so’.<sup>6</sup><sup>4</sup> As he<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> did not listen to him’ the latter<br>put him under the ban. ‘Is not the Master’, the other<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> asked him, ‘afraid of the fire?’<sup>6</sup><sup>5</sup> ‘I’, the<br>former replied, ‘am Issi b. Judah<sup>6</sup><sup>6</sup> who is Issi b. Gur-aryeh<sup>6</sup><sup>7</sup> who is Issi b. Gamaliel who is Issi b.<br>Mahalalel, a brazen mortar<sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup> over which rust has no power’. ‘And I’, the other retorted, ‘am Shila b.<br>Abina, an iron pestle that breaks the brazen mortar Thereupon R. Assi fell ill and they had to put him<br>in hot [blankets] to relieve him from chills and in cold [compresses] to relieve him from heat,<sup>6</sup><sup>9</sup> and<br>his soul departed to its eternal rest.<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) And bleeding.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) That intervene between the menstrual periods and during which a discharge of blood is ordinarily attributed to zibah.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) As the pains ceased before birth it is evident that the previous discharge (cf. prev. n. but one) was not due to the<br>labour but to zibah. Had the pains continued until birth all the previous bleeding would have been attributed to that of the<br>labour which is Pentateuchally clean.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) As result of which the bleeding must be regarded as zibah and is not to be attributed to the labour.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Not merely for twenty-four hours that began and ended at any time of the day or the night.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Which begins at sunset of Friday and terminates at that of Saturday.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) I.e., even if she was bleeding, the relief from pain alone suffices to subject her to the uncleanness of zibah.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) In respect of exempting the woman from zibah (cf. supra p. <sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>. n. <sup>8</sup>) even if she bled.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Prior to childbirth; provided only that there was no period of relief from pain (as defined supra) before birth.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Sc. only blood discharged during that month may be attributed to labour. Should the discharge begin during the<br>‘eleven days’ of the previous month and continue for three days she is deemed a zabah (on account of the discharge on<br>these three days) even though the bleeding continued throughout the ninth month also.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Since our Mishnah seems to lay down a general rule.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) But this, surely, is absurd. During the eleven days of zibah the woman could not be regarded as a MENSTRUANT<br>but as a zabah.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) Even if the discharge in the course of her labour occurred during the eleven days of zibah.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) And on undergoing immersion in the evening she attains to cleanness. A woman who was not in labour, if she had<br>such a discharge, must allow another day (free from any discharge) to pass before she can attain to cleanness.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) In accordance with Rabbinic law, though Pentateuchally this is not necessary.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Before childbirth. As a result it would be evident that the discharge was one of zibah and the man cohabiting with<br>the woman would be subject to kareth in Pentateuchal law. The woman, like any other who observed a discharge during<br>the eleven days of zibah, must consequently remain unclean until another day, that was free from any further discharge,<br>had passed.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Even during the ‘eleven days’ of zibah.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Sc. it is regarded as the blood of labour and the woman is deemed to be clean even on the same day.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Sc. the period during which a discharge is deemed to be menstrual.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Though in labour.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) The reason is given infra.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Cf. prev. n. but one mut. mut.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) While still bleeding.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Lit., ‘near’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) Where her discharge continued for three days.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) The release from pain serving as proof that the previous discharge was not due to childbirth but to zibah.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) Even if only for a short while.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) Ordinarily it is the discharge on the third day that causes a woman to be a confirmed or major zabah.

She prepared his shroud for him; and when<br>the soul of Shila came to its eternal rest people saw a myrtle<sup>1</sup> flying from the one bier to the other.<br>‘We may conclude’, they said, ‘that the Rabbis have been reconciled.’<br>Raba enquired: Does labour<sup>2</sup> render all previous counting in zibah<sup>3</sup> void? Does any discharge that<br>causes uncleanness render all previous counting void and, therefore, this also [does it, since] it<br>causes uncleanness like the days of menstruation; or is it possible that only that which<sup>4</sup> causes the<br>uncleanness of zibah that renders all the previous counting void, and this, therefore, [does not do it,<br>since] it is no cause of such uncleanness? — Abaye replied: A zibah that is due to an accident<br>provides the answer,<sup>5</sup> for this is no cause of the uncleanness of zibah<sup>6</sup> and yet renders all previous<br>counting void.<sup>7</sup> The other retorted: Indeed, this<sup>8</sup> also is a cause of the uncleanness of zibah, for we<br>have learnt: If he observed a first discharge he must be examined, if he observed a second discharge<br>he must be examined, but if he observed a third he need not be examined.<sup>9</sup> But according to R.<br>Eliezer who ruled, ‘Even after a third discharge he must be examined’<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> would you also maintain<br>that, since it is no cause of the uncleanness of zibah, it does not render the previous counting void?<br>— The other replied: According to R. Eliezer the law is so indeed.<br>Come and hear: R. Eliezer ruled, Even after a third discharge he must be examined, but after a<br>fourth one he need not be examined.<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> Does not this refer to the rendering of previous counting<br>void?<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> — No, to the imposition on that drop of an uncleanness that may be conveyed through<br>carriage.<br>Come and hear: After a third discharge. R. Eliezer ruled, he must be examined; after a fourth one<br>he need not be examined; and it is in regard to a sacrifice that I said this<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> but not in regard to the<br>rendering void of all previous counting.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> But the fact is that<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> according to R. Eliezer you may well<br>solve from here that even that which causes no uncleanness of zibah renders all previous counting<br>void. What, however, [it is asked], is the solution of the problem according to the Rabbis? — Come<br>and hear what the father of R. Abin learnt: ‘What had his zibah caused him? Seven days.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> Hence it<br>renders void the counting of seven days. What had his emission of semen caused him? The<br>[uncleanness of] one day. Hence it renders void the counting of one day’. Now what is meant by<br>‘seven days’? If it be suggested that it causes him to be unclean for seven days, [the objection would<br>arise that] in that case it should have been said: As on account of his zibah he is unclean for seven<br>days. Consequently<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> it follows, that only that which causes the uncleanness of zibah renders void<br>the counting of the seven days, but that which does not cause the uncleanness of zibah does not<br>render void all previous counting. This is conclusive. Abaye stated: We have an accepted tradition<br>that labour does not render void all previous counting in zibah; and should you find a Tanna who<br>said that it did render the counting void, that must be R. Eliezer.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup><br>It was taught: R. Marinus ruled, A birth does not render void the previous counting after a zibah.<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup><br>The question was raised: Is it included in the counting?<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> — Abaye replied: It neither renders void<br>the days that were previously counted<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> nor is it counted in the prescribed days.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> Raba replied: It<br>does not render void the days counted and it is counted among the prescribed days.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> Whence, said<br>Raba, do I derive this? From what was taught: And after that she shall be clean,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> ‘after’ means after<br>all of them, implying that no uncleanness may intervene between them.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> Now if you agree that<br>[these days]<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> are included one can well see the justification for saying that no uncleanness may<br>intervene between them, but if you contend that these days<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> are not included the birth, surely, would<br>cause a break between them. And Abaye?<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> — He can answer you: The meaning is that the<br>uncleanness of zibah shall not intervene between them.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> Whence, said Raba, do I derive this? From<br>what was taught: Of her issue,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> ‘of her issue’ implies but not of her leprosy,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> ‘of her issue’ but not<br>of her childbirth.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> And Abaye?<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> — He can answer you: Deduce once ‘Of her issue<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> but not of her<br>leprosy’ and do not deduce again, ‘but not of her childbirth’. And Raba?<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> — What an argument is<br>this!<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> If you agree that ‘of her issue’<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> implies ‘but not of her childbirth’ one can well justify the<br>text; for since it was required for the deduction about childbirth, leprosy also was mentioned on<br>account of childbirth; but if you contend that ‘of her issue’ implies only ‘but not of her leprosy’, [the<br>objection would arise] that this could be deduced from And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of<br>his issue,<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> which implies ‘of his issue’ and not of his leprosy. And Abaye?<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> — One<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> refers to a<br>zab and the other to a zabah, both being necessary. For if the All Merciful had only written<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) It was customary to lay a myrtle on a bier (Rashi).<br>(<sup>2</sup>) That was accompanied by bleeding.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) The prescribed seven days.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) By appearing on three days.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Lit., proves’.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) As was stated supra.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) V. infra.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Zibah that is due to an accident.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Zabim II, <sup>2</sup>. Thus it is shown that a third discharge, even if it was due to an accident, provided the first two<br>discharges were not due to such a cause, renders a person a confirmed or major zab.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Zabim l.c., which proves that zibah that is due to an accident never causes a person to be a confirmed zab.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Cf. supra <sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>a, Naz. <sup>6</sup><sup>5</sup>b.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) An objection against Raba, who laid down that that which is no cause of the uncleanness of zibah does not render<br>void the previous counting.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) That an examination is necessary.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) The counting being always void and is in no way dependent on an examination. Now does not this then prove that<br>even that which causes no uncleanness of zibah renders the counting void?<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) Contrary to what has been explained before.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) This is explained presently.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Since the expression used was ‘caused’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Who holds that zibah due to an accident, though it causes no zibah uncleanness, renders void all previous counting.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) If the counting was interrupted by a birth it may be continued after the birth had taken place.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Sc. if the birth took place during the seven days following a zibah, and the days following it were free from all<br>discharge, are these days counted as clean ones and make up the required number of seven?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) The counting must be resumed after the clean days of birth have passed.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) If the days after birth were free from all discharge.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lev. XV. <sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Supra <sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>b.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) That follow a birth.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) How in view of this argument can he maintain his view?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) That of childbirth does not matter.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) Sc. as soon as she counted the days prescribed for zibah (cf. Lev. XV, <sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) she brings the required sacrifice, and<br>attains cleanness from zibah irrespective of whether she was or was not still afflicted with leprosy.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) As soon as she is free from her zibah she begins to count the seven days and need not wait until the unclean days of<br>childbirth had passed. It is thus obvious that a birth during the days of zibah does not render void the previous counting<br>and that the days following birth are included in the counting.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) How in view of this argument can he maintain his view?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Lev. XV, <sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) How can he make two deductions from the same expression?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lit., that, what’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) Lev.

        "of a zab it might have been presumed to apply to him only, since he does not become unclean<br>through a discharge that is due to an accident, but not to a zabah who becomes unclean even through<br>a discharge that is due to an accident. Hence the necessity for the text about the zabah. And if the All<br>Merciful had written only of a zabah, it might have been presumed to apply only to her, since she<br>does not become unclean through observations [on less than three days] as on [three] days,<sup>1</sup> but not<br>to a zab who becomes unclean through [three] observations<sup>2</sup> as [through observations on three]<br>days.<sup>3</sup> Hence both texts were required.<br>Said Abaye: Whence do I derive this?<sup>4</sup> From what was taught: Her sickness shall she be unclean,<sup>5</sup><br>includes the man who had intercourse with her; ‘her sickness shall she be unclean’ includes the<br>nights;<sup>6</sup> ‘her sickness shall she be unclean’ includes a woman who gave birth in zibah who is<br>required to continue in her uncleanness until seven clean days have passed. Now does not this mean:<br>Clean from the uncleanness of birth?<sup>7</sup> — No, clean from that of blood.<sup>8</sup><br>Abaye further stated, Whence do I derive this?<sup>9</sup> From what was taught: As are the days of her<br>menstruation so are the days of her bearing. As the days of her menstruation are not suitable [for<br>counting as the days] after her zibah<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> and they cannot be included in the counting of the prescribed<br>seven days, so also the days following her bearing which<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> are not suitable [for counting as the days]<br>after her zibah may not<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> be included in the counting of the seven prescribed days. And Raba? —<br>This is in agreement with<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> R. Eliezer who ruled: It<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> also renders void all previous counting.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> But<br>may an inference be drawn from the impossible<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> for the possible?<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> R. Ahadboy b. Ammi replied:<br>This is the view of R. Eliezer who holds that the possible may be inferred from the impossible.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> R.<br>Shesheth, however, replied: Scripture has perforce compared them<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> to one another.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup><br>There are some who say: R. Ahadboy b. Ammi citing R. Shesheth replied. This represents the<br>view of R. Eliezer who holds that the possible may be deduced from the impossible; but R. Papa<br>replied: Scripture has perforce compared them to one another.<br>IF HAVING BEEN IN LABOUR FOR THREE DAYS etc. The question was raised: What is the<br>ruling where she was relieved from both?<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> — R. Hisda replied: She is unclean.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> R. Hanina replied:<br>She is clean.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> R. Hanina explained: This may be compared to a king who, when going on a tour, is<br>preceded<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> by his troops and it is known that they are the king's troops.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> But R. Hisda, said:<br>[Immediately before his arrival] he would require even more troops.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup><br>We learnt: R. JOSHUA RULED, THE RELIEF FROM PAIN MUST HAVE CONTINUED FOR<br>A NIGHT AND A DAY. AS THE NIGHT AND THE DAY OF THE SABBATH. THE RELIEF<br>[SPOKEN OF IS ONE] FROM PAIN, NOT FROM BLEEDING. The reason then<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> is because [she<br>had relief] FROM PAIN and NOT FROM BLEEDING, but if she had relief from both<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> she is clean.<br>Does not this present an objection against R. Hisda? — R. Hisda can answer you: There was no need<br>to state that, if she had relief from both, she is unclean, since [metaphorically] the troops completely<br>disappeared; but even where she had relief from pain and not from bleeding where it might have<br>been presumed that as she had not ceased to bleed she has not ceased to labour either and that it was<br>merely stupor that seized her. Hence we were informed [that even in this case she is unclean].<br>We learnt: IF HAVING BEEN IN LABOUR FOR THREE DAYS OF THE ELEVEN DAYS,<br>SHE WAS RELIEVED FROM HER PAINS FOR TWENTY-FOUR HOURS AND THEN GAVE<br>BIRTH. SHE IS REGARDED AS HAVING GIVEN BIRTH IN ZIBAH. Now, how are we to<br>imagine the circumstances? If it be suggested: As it was stated,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> [the objection would arise:] What<br>need was there to mention THREE seeing that it suffices<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> if the labour lasted two days and the<br>relief<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> one day? Consequently it must be this that was meant: IF HAVING BEEN IN LABOUR<br>FOR THREE DAYS she was relieved from both,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> or if having been in labour for two days, SHE<br>WAS RELIEVED FROM HER PAINS FOR TWENTY-FOUR HOURS, SHE IS REGARDED AS<br>HAVING GIVEN BIRTH IN ZIBAH, and this presents, does it not, an objection against R. Hanina?<br>— R. Hanina can answer you: No; the circumstances may in fact be as stated,<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> but it is this that we<br>were informed, that although the labour continued<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> [for a part only] of the third day and she was<br>relieved from her pains for twenty-four hours<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> she is nevertheless unclean, contrary to the view<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> of<br>R.

Meir used to say. A woman may sometimes bleed<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> for a hundred and fifty<br>days<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> without becoming a major zabah.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> How? The two days<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> preceding the period of her<br>menstruation,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> the seven days of menstruation, two days after menstruation,<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> fifty days<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> which<br>childbirth causes to be clean, eighty days<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> prescribed for a female birth,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> seven days of<br>menstruation<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> and the two days<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> after the menstruation.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> If so,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> they<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> said to him, might not a<br>woman bleed all the days of her life and no major zibah would occur in them?<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> — He replied:<br>‘What is it that you have in mind? Is it the possibility of frequent abortions? The law of protracted<br>labour<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> does not apply to abortions’.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: A woman may sometimes<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> observe a discharge on a hundred days and yet no<br>major zibah would result from it. How? The two days<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> prior to the time of menstruation,<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> the seven<br>days of menstruation, two days after menstruation,<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> eighty days following the birth of a female<br>child,<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> seven days of menstruation and the two days<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> after menstruation. What new law does this<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup><br>teach us? — That the law differs<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> from him who ruled that it was impossible for the uterus to open<br>without some bleeding, [since thereby]<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> we were informed that it is possible for the uterus to open<br>without previous bleeding.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup><br>R. JUDAH RULED: . . . SUFFICES FOR HER etc. It was taught: R. Judah citing R. Tarfon ruled,<br>Her [ninth] month suffices for her<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> and in this there is one aspect of a relaxation of the law<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> and<br>one of restriction.<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> How? If she was in labour for two days at the end of the eighth month and for<br>one day at the beginning of the ninth month, even though she gave birth to the child at the beginning<br>of the ninth month, she is regarded as having born it in zibah;<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> but if she was in labour for one day<br>at the end of the eighth month and for two days at the beginning of the ninth, even though she bore<br>the child at the end of the ninth month,<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> she is not regarded as having given birth in zibah.<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> Said R.<br>Adda b. Ahabah: From this<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> it may be inferred that R. Judah holds that it is the shofar<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> that is the<br>cause.<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> But could this<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> be right,<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> seeing that Samuel stated: A woman can conceive and bear only<br>on the two hundred and seventy-first day<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> or on the two hundred and seventy-second day<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> or on<br>the two hundred and seventy-third day?<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> He<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> follows the view of the pious men of old; for it was<br>taught: The pious men of old performed their marital duty on a Wednesday only, in order that their<br>wives<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> should not be led to<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup><br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) I.e., for ever, since any seven days following a discharge that occurred within any seven days counted after a<br>previous discharge are suitable for counting.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Once labour began within the eleven days of zibah all subsequent days are clean unless the woman was relieved from<br>her pain for the prescribed period, prior to the birth of the child.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Since the counting of the days may sometimes continue for a very long time (cf. prev. n. but one).<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Who restricts the labour and birth to the eleven days of zibah.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Sc. how is it possible for a woman to be clean when labour is protracted for forty or fifty days?<br>(<sup>6</sup>) The forty or fifty days.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) After the protracted labour.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) The purport of R. Meir's ruling being that there is no obligation to bring a sacrifice or to count the prescribed number<br>of clean days even though labour continued for forty or fifty days; but the woman remains clean only where the birth<br>occurred in the days of zibah. If it occurs, however, in the days of menstruation she becomes unclean.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Exempting the woman from a sacrifice and from the counting of seven clean days.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) I.e., where she experienced a discharge on three consecutive days in the course of the eleven days’ period. If the<br>discharge, however, appeared only on one day. she need not wait more than one clean day corresponding to the one<br>unclean day.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) In the text from which it was derived that a birth in zibah is a cause of cleanness.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Lev.

JOSE AND R. SIMEON RULED: PROTRACTED LABOUR CANNOT CONTINUE FOR<br>MORE THAN TWO WEEKS. Samuel stated: What is the reason of the Rabbis? Because it is written<br>in Scripture. Then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her menstruation,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> which implies: Only ‘as<br>in her menstruation’ but not as in her zibah; from which it follows that her zibah is clean for<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> ‘two<br>weeks’.<br>Our Rabbis taught: A woman may sometimes be in labour<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> for twenty-five days and no major<br>zibah would intervene.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> How? Two days preceding her menstruation period;<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> seven days of<br>menstruation, two days following menstruation and the fourteen days which<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> the childbirth causes<br>to be clean. It is impossible, however, for her to be in labour for twenty-six days, where there is no<br>child,<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> without giving birth to it is in zibah.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> But if there was no child would not<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> three days<br>suffice?<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> — R. Shesheth replied. Read: Where there is a child. Said Raba to him: But was it not<br>stated ‘where there is no child’? Rather, said Raba, it is this that was meant: It is impossible for her<br>to be in labour for twenty-six days, where there is a child, without giving birth to it in zibah; and<br>where there is no child but an abortion she is a zabah even after three days. What is the reason? —<br>The law of protracted labour<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> does not apply to abortions. MISHNAH. IF A WOMAN WAS IN<br>PROTRACTED LABOUR DURING THE EIGHTY DAYS<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> PRESCRIBED FOR THE BIRTH OF<br>A FEMALE, ALL KINDS OF BLOOD THAT SHE MAY OBSERVE<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> ARE CLEAN,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> UNTIL<br>THE CHILD IS BORN, BUT R. ELIEZER HOLDS THEM TO BE UNCLEAN.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> THEY SAID TO<br>R. ELIEZER: IF IN A CASE WHERE THE LAW WAS RESTRICTED IN REGARD TO BLOOD<br>DISCHARGED IN THE ABSENCE OF PAIN,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> IT WAS NEVERTHELESS RELAXED.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> IN<br>REGARD TO BLOOD DISCHARGED DURING PROTRACTED LABOUR, IS THERE NOT<br>EVEN MORE REASON TO RELAX THE LAW<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> IN REGARD TO THE BLOOD OF LABOUR<br>IN A CASE WHERE<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> IT WAS RELAXED<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> EVEN IN REGARD TO A DISCHARGE IN THE<br>ABSENCE OF PAIN?<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> HE REPLIED: IT IS ENOUGH THAT THE CASE INFERRED<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> SHALL<br>BE TREATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE ONE<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> FROM WHICH IT IS INFERRED. FOR<br>IN WHAT RESPECT WAS THE LAW RELAXED FOR A WOMAN IN THE LATTER CASE?<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup><br>IN THAT OF THE UNCLEANNESS OF ZIBAH<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> ONLY; WHILE SHE IS STILL SUBJECT TO<br>THE UNCLEANNESS OF THE MENSTRUANT.<br><b>GEMARA</b>. Our Rabbis taught: She shall continue [in the blood of her purification],<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> includes a<br>woman who was in protracted labour during the eighty days<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> prescribed for the birth of a female,<br>viz., that all kinds of blood that she may observe are clean, until the embryo is born,<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> but R. Eliezer<br>holds them to be unclean. They said to R. Eliezer: If in the case where the law was restricted in<br>regard to blood discharged in the absence of pain before the child was born,<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> it was nevertheless<br>relaxed in regard to blood discharged in the absence of pain after the child was born,<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> is there not<br>even more reason to relax the law in regard to the blood of labour after the child was born<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> in a case<br>where it was relaxed in regard to the blood of labour before the child was born? He replied: It is<br>enough that the case inferred<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> shall be treated in the same manner as the ones from which it is<br>inferred. For in what respect was the law relaxed for a woman in the latter case?<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> In that of the<br>uncleanness of zibah only, while she is still subject to the uncleanness of the menstruant. They said<br>to him, We would submit to you an objection in a different form: If in the case where the law was<br>restricted in regard to blood discharged in the absence of pain before the child was born,<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> it was<br>nevertheless relaxed in regard to blood discharged at such a time<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> in protracted labour, is there not<br>even more reason that, where ‘the law was relaxed in regard to blood discharged in the absence of<br>pain after the child was born,<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> the law should be relaxed in regard to blood discharged at such a<br>time<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> during protracted labour? He replied: Even if you were to offer objections all day long it must<br>be enough that the case inferred<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> shall be treated in the same manner as the one<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> from which it is<br>inferred. For in what respect was the law relaxed for a woman in the latter case?<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> In that of the<br>uncleanness of zibah only, while she is still subject to the uncleanness of the menstruant. Raba<br>observed, R. Eliezer could successfully have offered the Rabbis the following reply: Did you not<br>explain Her blood<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> thus: ‘Her blood’ refers to blood that is normally discharged, but not to such as<br>is due to childbirth?<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> Well, here also, it may be explained: And she shall be cleansed from the<br>fountain of her blood,<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> ‘her blood’ refers to blood that is normally discharged but not to such as is<br>due to childbirth.<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> But might it not be suggested<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> [that if a discharge occurred] during the days of<br>menstruation she is a menstruant, [while if it occurred] during the days of zibah she is clean? —<br>Scripture said, She shall continue,<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> which implies: One form of continuation throughout all these<br>days.<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup><br><b>MISHNAH</b>.

Joseph<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> remarked: I have not heard this traditional explanation.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> Said Abaye<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> to him, You<br>yourself have told it to us,<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> and it was in connection with the following that you told it to us: If she<br>was accustomed to observe a flow of menstrual blood on the fifteenth day,<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> and this was changed<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup><br>to the twentieth day,<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> marital intercourse is forbidden<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> on both dates.<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> If this was changed twice to<br>the twentieth day,<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> marital intercourse is again forbidden on both dates. And in connection with this<br>you have told us: Rab Judah citing Samuel explained. This<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> was learnt only [when she was<br>accustomed to observe a flow] on the fifteenth day after her ritual immersion<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> which is the<br>twenty-second day<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> after her observation of her discharge, since on such a day<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> she is already<br>within the days of her menstruation period,<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> but the fifteenth day after her observation, on which<br>she is still within the days of her zibah period,<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> cannot be established as a regular period. R. Papa<br>stated: I recited this tradition before R. Judah of Diskarta [and asked:] Granted that she cannot<br>establish thereby<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> a regular period,<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> must we take into consideration the possibility of such a<br>regular period?<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> The latter remained silent and said nothing at all. Said R. Papa: Let us look into the<br>matter ourselves.

        "And in connection with this Rab Judah citing Samuel stated: This<sup>1</sup> was learnt only [when she was<br>accustomed to observe a flow] on the fifteenth day after her ritual immersion,<sup>2</sup> which is the<br>twenty-second day<sup>3</sup> after her observation of her discharge, and it was changed to the twenty-seventh<br>day<sup>4</sup> so that when the twenty-second day<sup>5</sup> comes round again she is well within the days of her zibah<br>period,<sup>6</sup> and yet it was stated that intercourse was forbidden on both days. It is thus clear that the<br>possibility of a regular period<sup>7</sup> must be taken into consideration.<sup>8</sup> R. Papa is thus<sup>9</sup> of the opinion that<br>the twenty-two days<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> are reckoned from the twenty-second day<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> while the beginning of the<br>menstruation and zibah period<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> is reckoned from the twenty-seventh day.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> Said R. Huna son of R.<br>Joshua to R. Papa: Whence do you draw your ruling? Is it not possible that the twenty-second day<br>also is reckoned from the twenty-seventh day,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> so that when the twenty-second day comes round<br>again the woman is within the days of her menstruation period?<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> And this<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> is also logical. For if<br>you do not admit this,<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> consider the case of a<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> hen that laid eggs on alternate days<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> and once<br>ceased laying for two days and again laid on the following day. When it reverts to its former habit,<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup><br>does it do so in accordance with the present<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> or in accordance with the past?<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> You have no<br>alternative but to admit that it would do it in accordance with the present.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> Said R. Papa to him:<br>With reference, however, to what Resh Lakish ruled, ‘A woman may establish for herself a settled<br>period during the days of her zibah but not during the days of her menstruation’ and to what R.<br>Johanan ruled, ‘A woman may establish for herself a settled period during the days of her<br>menstruation’, is not one to understand this as being a case,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> for instance, where she observed a<br>discharge on the first day of the month, on the fifth of the month and again on the first of the second<br>month and on the fifth of that month, and finally<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> she observed a discharge on the fifth of the month<br>while on the first of that month she observed none? And yet it was stated that ‘a woman may<br>establish for herself a settled period during the days of her menstruation’. It thus clearly follows<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup><br>that we reckon the days from the first day of the month?<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> — No, the other replied, it is this that R.<br>Johanan meant: A woman, for instance, who observed a discharge on the first day of the month, on<br>the first day of the next month and on the twenty-fifth of that month, and on the first day of the<br>following month, in which case we presume that<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> she experienced an influx of additional blood.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup><br>So also Rabin and all seafarers, when they came,<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> reported the tradition<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> in agreement with the<br>explanation of R.

Similarly, in the case of the woman, a reversion to her<br>regular periods can only be effected by counting the days from the one on which her discharge last appeared, viz., from<br>the twenty-seventh day.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘how is one to imagine, not?’<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Lit., ‘and now’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) Since the fifth day of the month is regarded as of the ‘days of her menstruation’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Though on that day no discharge had appeared. From which it follows that the counting of the days begins from the<br>day on which the discharge should have appeared and not from that on which it appeared the last time.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) The reason why the discharge made its appearance on the twenty-fifth day of the second month and not on the first<br>day of the following month.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) And, as a result, the discharge whose regular time of appearance was still the first of the month made its appearance<br>a little earlier. The first day of the month being within seven days from the twenty-fifth of the previous month (on which<br>the discharge appeared) may well be described as within the days of menstruation.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) From Palestine to Babylon.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) Of R.

R. Mani b. Pattish stated: What is the Rabbis’ reason?<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> Scripture said, If a woman<br>have conceived seed and born<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> a man child,<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> implying:<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> Only if she bears where she conceives.<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup><br>And R. Simeon?<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> — That text<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> implies that even if she bore in the same manner only as she<br>conceived<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> she<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> is unclean by reason of childbirth.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> What, however, is R. Simeon's reason?<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> —<br>Resh Lakish replied: Scripture said, She bear,<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> to include<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> A FOETUS BORN FROM ITS<br>MOTHER'S SIDE. And the Rabbis?<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> — That text<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> is required to include<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> a tumtum<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> and an<br>hermaphrodite. Since it might have been presumed that as it is written man child<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> and maid child<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup><br>[the laws in the context apply only to] one who is undoubtedly male or undoubtedly female but not<br>to a tumtum or an hermaphrodite, hence we were informed that the law applies to the latter also. And<br>R. Simeon?<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> — He deduces it<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> from a teaching of Bar Liwai; for Bar Liwai taught. For a son,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup><br>implies: For any son, whatsoever his nature; For a daughter,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> for any daughter, whatsoever her<br>nature. And the Rabbis?<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> — They require this text for the deduction that a separate sacrifice is due<br>for each son and for each daughter.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> And R. Simeon?<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> — He deduced it<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> from the following<br>which a Tanna recited before R. Shesheth: This is the law for her that beareth<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> teaches<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> that a<br>woman brings one sacrifice for many children. It might be presumed that she brings only one<br>sacrifice for a birth and for a zibah . . . But would then one sacrifice suffice for a woman after<br>childbirth who ate blood or for one after childbirth who ate forbidden fat? — Rather say: It might be<br>presumed that a woman brings only one sacrifice for a birth that took place before the completion of<br>her clean days and for one that took place after their completion.<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> Therefore it was expressly<br>written, ‘This’.<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> And the Rabbis?<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> — Although ‘this’<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> was written it was also necessary to have<br>the text, ‘For a son or for a daughter’.<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> For it might have been presumed that this law<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> applies only<br>to two distinct conceptions<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> but<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> that in the case of a simultaneous conception as, for instance, that<br>of Judah and Hezekiah the sons of R. Hiyya,<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> one sacrifice suffices,<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> hence we were informed [that<br>even in such a case separate sacrifices are required for each birth].<br>R. Johanan stated: R. Simeon, however, agrees that in the case of consecrated beasts [the body of<br>the young extracted by means of a caesarean cut] is not sacred.<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> What is the reason? He deduces the<br>expression of ‘birth’ here<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> from that of ‘birth’ in the case of the firstling:<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> As in the latter case<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> the<br>reference is to one that openeth the womb<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> so here also it is only to one that ‘openeth the womb’.<br>But why should not the expression of ‘birth’ here<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> be deduced from that of ‘birth’ in the case of a<br>human being:<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> As in the latter case<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> a foetus extracted from its mother's side is included<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> so here<br>also the young extracted from its mother's side should be included? — It stands to reason that the<br>deduction should be made from the firstling, since ‘the dam’<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> might also be deduced from ‘the<br>dam’.<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> On the contrary! Should not the deduction be made from the expression used of the human<br>being, since thereby an ordinary birth<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> would be deduced from an ordinary birth?<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> But the fact is<br>that the deduction was properly to be made from the firstling since in both cases<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> the expression<br>‘dam’<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> is used, both are sacred beasts and both are subject to the laws of piggul, nothar<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> and<br>uncleanness.<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> On the contrary! Should not the deduction be made from the expression used of the<br>human being since both cases<sup>6</sup><sup>4</sup> are those of ordinary birth,<sup>6</sup><sup>5</sup> neither is restricted to the male sex,<sup>6</sup><sup>6</sup><br>neither<sup>6</sup><sup>7</sup> is naturally sacred,<sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup> and neither<sup>6</sup><sup>9</sup> is a priestly gift?<sup>7</sup><sup>0</sup> The former<sup>7</sup><sup>1</sup> are more in number.<sup>7</sup><sup>2</sup><br>R.

        "excluding<sup>1</sup> a sacrifice that was slain in the night, whose blood was poured out,<sup>2</sup> or whose blood was<br>taken outside the hangings,<sup>3</sup> which, even though it was placed upon the altar, must be taken down.<sup>4</sup><br>R. Simeon stated: From the term ‘burnt-offering’<sup>5</sup> I would only know that the law applied to<sup>6</sup> a valid<br>burnt-offering; whence, however, the inference for including<sup>7</sup> one that was slain in the night, whose<br>blood was poured out,<sup>8</sup> whose blood was taken outside the hangings<sup>3</sup> or was kept overnight, that was<br>taken out,<sup>9</sup> that was unclean, nothar,<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> one slain with the intention of eating it later than its permitted<br>time limit or beyond its permitted place limits, whose blood was received or sprinkled by<br>disqualified men,<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> those sacrifices whose blood is to be sprinkled above<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> and was sprinkled<br>below,<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> those whose blood is to be sprinkled below<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> and was sprinkled above,<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> those whose blood<br>is to be applied within<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> and was applied without,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> and a paschal lamb and a sin-offering that had<br>not been slain as such?<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> Whence, I ask, is the inference? Since it was explicitly said in Scripture,<br>This is the law of the burnt-offering,<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> the scope of the law is widened: One law for all that are<br>placed upon the altar, so that once they have been put up they must not be taken down. As one might<br>presume that I also include<sup>7</sup> a beast that covered<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> or was covered,<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> that was set aside<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> for an<br>idolatrous purpose, that was worshipped, the hire of a harlot, the price of a dog, kil'ayim, trefah<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> and<br>one that had been extracted by means of a caesarean operation, it was explicitly stated, ‘This’.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> But<br>what reason do you see for including<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> the former and for excluding the latter?<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) From the scope of the law in the context that once a sacrifice had been placed upon the altar it must never be<br>removed from it.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) So that the essential service of sprinkling upon the altar could not be performed with it.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Sc. the enclosure around the Temple that corresponded to the hangings of the court of the Tabernacle of Moses in the<br>wilderness.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Only the other disqualified sacrifices, enumerated infra in R.

        "Since Scripture both widened and limited the scope of the law, you might rightly say:<sup>1</sup> I include the<br>former whose disqualification arose within the Sanctuary and exclude the latter whose<br>disqualification did not arise within the Sanctuary.<sup>2</sup> At all events, it was here taught that the young<br>extracted by means of a caesarean operation is not included in the scope of the law;<sup>3</sup> and this refers,<br>does it not, to the young that were so extracted in the case of a consecrated beast?<sup>4</sup> — R. Huna son<br>of R. Nathan replied: No, the reference is to one so extracted in the case of a firstling. But is not the<br>law of the firstling<sup>5</sup> deduced from the expression of openeth the womb.<sup>6</sup> What then do you suggest?<br>That the reference is to one of the consecrated beasts? Is not<sup>7</sup> this [it could be retorted] inferred from<br>a deduction of ‘the dam’ from ‘the dam’?<sup>8</sup> — What a comparison!<sup>9</sup> If you grant that the reference is<br>to a consecrated beast one can well understand the necessity for two Scriptural texts:<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> One<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> to<br>exclude<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> the young of an unconsecrated beast born by way of a caesarean cut and then consecrated,<br>and the other,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> to exclude<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> the young of a consecrated beast<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> born by way of the caesarean cut,<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup><br>he being of the opinion that the young of consecrated beasts become sacred only after they come into<br>a visible existence,<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> but if you maintain that the reference is to a firstling [the objection would<br>arise:] Is not this<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> deduced from the expression openeth the womb?<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> This<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> may also be supported<br>by reason. For ‘a beast that covered or was covered, that was set aside for an idolatrous purpose, that<br>was worshipped and kil'ayim’ were mentioned.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> Now is the law concerning these deduced from this<br>text?<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> Is it not in fact deduced from a different text:<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> Of the cattle<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> excludes<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> a beast that covered<br>or was covered, Of the herd<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> excludes<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> a beast that was worshipped, Of the flock<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> excludes<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> one<br>that was set aside for an idolatrous purpose, Or of the flock<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> excludes<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> one that gores?<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> And,<br>furthermore, is the law concerning kil'ayim<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> deduced from here? Is it not in fact deduced from a<br>different text: When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth;<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> ‘a bullock’ excludes kil'ayim,<br>‘or a goat’ excludes one that<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> only resembles it?<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> But the fact is that two series of texts were<br>required there: One in connection with an unconsecrated beast<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> and the other in connection with a<br>consecrated beast; well then, in this case also two texts were similarly required.<br>Our Rabbis taught: If a woman was in protracted labour<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> for three days,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> but the embryo was<br>born by way of a caesarean cut, she is to be regarded as having given birth in zibah.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> R. Simeon,<br>however,<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> ruled: A woman in such circumstances is not regarded as<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> having given birth in zibah.<br>The blood, furthermore, that issues from that place<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> is unclean, but R. Simeon declared it clean. The<br>first clause may be well understood, since R. Simeon follows his known view<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> and the Rabbis<br>follow theirs; on what principle, however, do they differ in the final clause?<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> — Rabina replied:<br>This is a case where, for instance, the embryo was born through the side<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) By recourse to a process of reasoning.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) V.

XXXIV, <sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>; emphasis on the last word. Now since it is not sacred it is obviously to be treated like an ordinary<br>beast and must be removed from the altar even after it had been placed upon it; what need then was there to exclude it by<br>the text of Lev. VI, <sup>2</sup>.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) That the one so extracted is not sacred.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Supra <sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>a ad fin.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Lit., ‘that, what’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) ‘This’ and ‘the dam’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) ‘The dam’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) From sanctity, in consequence of which it must be removed from the altar even after it had been placed on it.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) ‘This’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) From the law that requires a sacrifice that was once upon the altar never to be taken down.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) Though the dam is sacred.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Since the disqualification arose without the Sanctuary.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Sc. on being born, but no earlier; and when the young was born it was already disqualified.

Simeon, who<br>regards the birth as valid, the blood should be unclean while according to the Rabbis it should be clean.",
        "while the blood issued<sup>1</sup> through the womb; and R. Simeon follows his view while the Rabbis follow<br>theirs.<sup>2</sup> R. Joseph demurred: Firstly, is not then the final clause identical with the first?<sup>3</sup> And,<br>furthermore, ‘from that place’ means, does it not, the place of birth?<sup>4</sup> Rather, said R. Joseph, this is a<br>case, where, for instance, both the embryo and the blood issued through the side,<sup>5</sup> and the point at<br>issue between them<sup>6</sup> is whether the interior of the uterus is unclean. The Masters hold that the<br>interior of the uterus is unclean,<sup>7</sup> while the Master holds that the interior of the uterus is clean.<sup>8</sup><br>Resh Lakish stated: According to him who holds the blood to be unclean the woman also<sup>9</sup> is<br>unclean<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> and according to him who holds the blood to be clean the woman also is clean. R. Johanan,<br>however, stated: Even according to him who holds the blood to be unclean the woman is clean. In<br>this R. Johanan follows a view he previously expressed. For R. Johanan citing R. Simeon b. Yohai<br>stated: Whence is it deduced that a woman is not unclean<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> unless the discharge issues through its<br>normal channel? From Scripture which says, And if a man shall lie with a woman having her<br>sickness,<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> and shall uncover her nakedness — he hath made naked her fountain,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> which teaches<br>that a woman is not unclean<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> unless the discharge of her sickness issues through its normal channel.<br>Resh Lakish citing R. Judah Nesi'ah<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> ruled: If the uterus<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> became detached and dropped upon<br>the ground the woman is unclean, for it is said, Because thy filthiness<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> was poured out,<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> and thy<br>nakedness<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> uncovered.<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> In what respect?<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> If it be suggested: In that of an uncleanness for seven<br>days<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> [the objection would arise:] Did not the All Merciful speak of blood and not of a solid piece?<br>— As a matter of fact the reference is to the uncleanness until evening.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup><br>R. Johanan ruled: If the uterus produced a discharge that was<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> like two pearl drops<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> the woman<br>is unclean. In what respect? Should it be suggested: In respect of an uncleanness for seven days<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> [it<br>might be objected:] Are there not just five unclean kinds of the blood for a woman, and no more? —<br>The fact is that the reference is to the uncleanness until evening.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> This, however, applies only to two<br>drops but if there was only one drop it may be assumed that it originated elsewhere.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup><br>ALL WOMEN ARE SUBJECT TO UNCLEANNESS [IF BLOOD APPEARED] IN THE<br>OUTER CHAMBER. Which is the OUTER CHAMBER? — Resh Lakish replied: All that part<br>which, when a child sits, is exposed. Said R. Johanan to him: Is not that place deemed exposed as<br>regards contact with a dead creeping thing?<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> Rather, said R. Johanan, as far as the glands.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> The<br>question was raised: Is the region between the glands regarded as internal or as external? — Come<br>and hear what R. Zakkai taught: The region up to the glands and that between the glands is regarded<br>as internal. In a Baraitha it was taught: As far as the threshing-place. What is meant by<br>threshing-place? — Rab Judah replied: The place where the attendant threshes.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: In her flesh<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> teaches that she<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> contracts uncleanness internally as externally.<br>But from this text I would only know of the menstruant, whence the deduction that the same law<br>applies to a zabah? It was explicitly stated, Her issue<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> in her flesh.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> Whence the proof that the same<br>law applies also to one who emitted semen? It was explicitly stated, Be.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> R. Simeon, however,<br>ruled: It is enough that she be subject to the same stringency of uncleanness as the man who had<br>intercourse with her. As he is not subject to uncleanness unless the unclean discharge issued forth, so<br>is she not subject to uncleanness unless her unclean discharge issued forth. But could R. Simeon<br>maintain that ‘it is enough that she be subject to the same stringency of uncleanness as the man who<br>had intercourse with her’? Was it not in fact taught: ‘They shall both bathe themselves in water, and<br>be unclean until the even.<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> What, said R. Simeon, does this<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> come to teach us? If that it applies<br>also to one who came in contact with semen<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> [it could be retorted:] Was it not in fact<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> stated<br>below, Or from whomsoever [the flow of seed goeth out]?<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> But [this is the purpose of the text:]<br>Since the uncleanness arises in a concealed region<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> and since an uncleanness in a concealed region<br>is elsewhere ineffective, a special Scriptural ordinance was required<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> [to give it effect in this<br>particular case]’<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> — This is no difficulty: The latter deals with one who received the semen at<br>intercourse,<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> while the former refers to one who ejected it subsequently.<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> ‘Ejected’! Should not her<br>uncleanness be due<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> to her preceding intercourse?<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> — This is a case where she had undergone<br>ritual immersion in respect of her intercourse.<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> This then<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> says that for one who had intercourse it<br>suffices to be unclean only until the evening. But did not Raba rule: A woman who had intercourse is<br>forbidden to eat terumah for three days since it is impossible that she should not eject some semen<br>during that time?<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> — Here<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> we are dealing with one who was immersed<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> with her bed.<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> It may<br>thus<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> be inferred that Raba<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> spoke of a woman<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> who went herself on foot and performed<br>immersion, but then is it not possible that she had ejected the semen while she was walking?<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup><br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) During the three days of labour, that preceded the birth.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Cf. supra no. <sup>2</sup>.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) It is; why then the needless repetition?<br>(<sup>4</sup>) How then could Rabina explain this as ‘the womb’?<br>(<sup>5</sup>) The clause thus differing from the first one which deals with an issue of blood from the normal place during labour.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) R. Simeon and the Rabbis.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) The blood that comes in contact with the uterus causes, therefore, uncleanness for a day until the evening, though,<br>having finally issued through the caesarean cut, it cannot be regarded as a menstrual discharge to subject the woman to<br>an uncleanness of seven days.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) The blood that issued through the caesarean cut, though it passed through the uterus, is, therefore, regarded as the<br>blood of a mere wound which conveys no uncleanness. Should the blood issue through the womb, provided there was no<br>relief from pain prior to the birth, the blood, as that of labour, would also, during the zibah period, be clean on account of<br>the birth of the child despite its emergence by way of a caesarean cut.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Though the birth was from her side.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Seven days, as a menstruant.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) As a menstruant.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Dawah, applied to the menstrual discharge.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lev.

XVI, <sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>; which shows that a uterus dropped out is as unclean as when it is in its place; hence the uncleanness.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Is the uncleanness caused.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) On account of the woman's external contact with the unclean uterus.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Lit., perspired’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) White and clear.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) The discharge having been in contact with the uterus which is in contact with the woman.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) Lit., ‘came from the world’, not from the uterus, and is consequently clean.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Sc. if the latter came in contact with that place uncleanness is conveyed to the woman though contact with an<br>internal organ conveys no uncleanness. Now since the place is deemed to be exposed, how can Resh Lakish apply to it<br>the expression ‘in her flesh’ (cf. infra) and regard it as internal?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) Of the vagina.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) Euphemism.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) Lev.

Why then the repetition?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) Of the body, where internal contact with the semen virile takes place.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) Lit., ‘it is’.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) From which it is evident that, according to R. Simeon, though a man is not subject to an uncleanness arising in an<br>unexposed region of the body, a woman is subject to such an uncleanness. How then could it be maintained that<br>according to R. Simeon ‘it is enough that she be subject to the same stringency of uncleanness as the man who had<br>intercourse with her’?<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) Whose uncleanness is due to a special Scriptural ordinance.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) And for whose uncleanness it is enough to be as stringent as that of the man.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘let it go out for him’.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) Cf. prev. n. but two.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) The ejection having taken place after the immersion.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) Since, as has been explained, the law subjecting the woman to ‘be unclean until the even’ (Lev. XV, <sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) applies to<br>one who had intercourse.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup>) After three days the semen becomes vapid and conveys uncleanness no longer. Now since during the three days the<br>woman invariably remains unclean, how, according to Raba, could R. Simeon rule that the woman is clean if she had<br>undergone ritual immersion before the three days have passed?<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup>) In R. Simeon's ruling (cf. prev. n.).<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup>) After intercourse.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>) As she herself did not move her body it is quite possible for her to avoid ejection.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup>) Since R. Simeon's rule, according to which the uncleanness terminates at evening, refers only to a woman who was<br>carried in a bed.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup>) Who holds the woman to be unclean for three days after intercourse.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘that when Raba said’.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup>) So that her subsequent immersion should render her completely free from both the uncleanness of intercourse and<br>that of the ejection. How then could Raba maintain that she is unclean for three days?",
        "And should you reply: It is possible that<sup>1</sup> some remained<sup>2</sup> [the objection would arise]: If so, should<br>not the expression used have been:<sup>3</sup> We take into consideration the possibility that some might have<br>remained? — The fact, however, is that according to Raba also this is a case where the woman was<br>immersed with her bed, but there is no difficulty since one ruling<sup>4</sup> deals with a woman who<sup>5</sup> turned<br>over<sup>6</sup> while the other<sup>7</sup> deals with one who<sup>5</sup> did not turn over;<sup>8</sup> and Raba<sup>9</sup> interpreted the Scriptural<br>text in this manner:<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> When Scripture wrote, They shall both bathe themselves in water and be<br>unclean until the even,<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> it referred to a woman who did not turn over but one who did turn over is<br>forbidden to eat terumah for three days since it is impossible that she should not eject some semen<br>during this time.<br>R. Samuel b. Bisna enquired of Abaye: ‘Is a woman ejecting semen<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> regarded as observing a<br>discharge or as coming in contact with one?<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> The practical issue<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> is the question of rendering<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> any<br>previous counting<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> void,<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> and of conveying uncleanness by means of the smallest quantity<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> and of<br>conveying uncleanness internally as well as externally’.<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> But what is the question?<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> If he<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> heard<br>of the Baraithas [he should have known that] according to the Rabbis she is regarded as observing a<br>discharge while according to R. Simeon she is regarded as coming in contact with one; and if he<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup><br>did not hear of the Baraitha,<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> is it not logical that<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> she should be regarded as coming in contact<br>with one?<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> — Indeed he may well have heard of the Baraitha and, as far as the Rabbis are<br>concerned, he had no question at all;<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> what he did ask concerned only the view of R. Simeon.<br>Furthermore, he had no question<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> as to whether uncleanness is conveyed internally as externally;<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup><br>what he did ask was whether any previous counting is rendered void and whether uncleanness is<br>conveyed by means of the smallest quantity. When [he asked in effect] R. Simeon ruled that ‘it is<br>enough that she be subject to the same stringency of uncleanness as the man who had intercourse<br>with her’ he meant it only in respect of conveying uncleanness internally as externally<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> but as<br>regards rendering any previous counting void and conveying uncleanness by means of the smallest<br>quantity she is regarded as one observing a discharge, or is it possible that<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> there is no difference?<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup><br>There are others who read: Indeed he<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> may never have heard of the Baraitha,<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> but<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> it is this that he<br>asked in effect: Since the All Merciful has considered it proper to impose a restriction<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> at Sinai on<br>those who emitted semen,<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> she must be regarded as one who observed a discharge, or is it possible<br>that no inference may be drawn from Sinai, since it was placed under an anomalous law, seeing that<br>zabs and lepers who are elsewhere subject to major restrictions were not subjected by the All<br>Merciful to that restriction?<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> — The other<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> replied: She is regarded as one who has observed a<br>discharge. He<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> then came to Raba<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> and put the question to him. The latter replied: She is regarded<br>as one who observed a discharge. He thereupon came to R. Joseph who also told him: She is<br>regarded as one who observed a discharge. He<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> then returned to Abaye and said to him: ‘You all<br>spit the same thing’,<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> ‘We’, the other replied, ‘only gave you the right answer. For when R. Simeon<br>ruled that \"it is enough that she be subject to the same stringency of uncleanness as the man who had<br>intercourse with her\" it was only in respect of conveying uncleanness internally as externally,<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> but<br>in respect of rendering any previous counting void and in respect of conveying uncleanness by<br>means of the smallest quantity she is regarded as one who observed a discharge.<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: A menstruant,<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> a zabah,<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> one who awaits a day for a day<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> and a woman<br>after childbirth<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> contract uncleanness internally<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> as well as externally. Now, the enumeration of<br>three of these cases<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> may well be justified, but how is one to explain the mention of the woman<br>after childbirth? If the birth<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> occurred during her menstruation period she is a menstruant,<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> and if it<br>occurred during her zibah period she is a zabah?<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> — The mention<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> was necessary only in the case<br>of one who went down<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> to perform ritual immersion in order to pass out thereby from the period of<br>uncleanness to that of cleanness;<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> and this<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> is in agreement with a ruling given by R. Zera citing R.<br>Hiyya b. Ashi who had it from Rab: If a woman after childbirth went down<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> to perform ritual<br>immersion in order to pass out thereby from her period of uncleanness to that of cleanness,<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> and<br>some blood was detached from her body,<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> while she was going down,<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> she is unclean,<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> but if it<br>occurred while she was going up, she is clean.<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> Said R. Jeremiah to R. Zera: Why should she be<br>unclean if this occurred ‘while she was going down’? Is not the blood merely an absorbed<br>uncleanness?<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> — Go, the other replied, and ask it of R. Abin to whom I have explained the point at<br>the schoolhouse and who nodded to me with his head.<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> He went and asked him [the question], and<br>the latter replied: This was treated like the carcass of a clean bird which<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> conveys uncleanness to<br>garments<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> while it is still passing through the oesophagus.<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> But are the two cases at all similar<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Even after the ejection.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) And that the uncleanness of which Raba spoke is due to this possibility.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Instead of the statement, ‘it is impossible that she should not eject’.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Raba's.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) After the immersion.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Hence ‘it is impossible that she etc.’.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) R. Simeon's.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Her uncleanness, therefore, terminates at evening.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) In his ruling.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Lit., ‘took his stand on the text and thus he said’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Lev. XV, <sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) After she had undergone ritual immersion and was freed thereby from the uncleanness of intercourse to which she<br>was subject (as stated supra) under a specific Scriptural ordinance.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) Externally. Internal contact, being within a concealed region, is (as stated supra <sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>b) of no consequence.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Between uncleanness through (a) observation and (b) contact.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) During the eleven days of zibah.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Of the prescribed seven days.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Which is the case with an observation but not with contact.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Lit., ‘what is your desire?’<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) R. Samuel who raised the question.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Supra <sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>b, where the Rabbis ruled that the ejection of semen conveys uncleanness internally as well as externally,<br>while R. Simeon ruled that it is enough for the woman to be as unclean as the man who had intercourse with her. For the<br>reading ‘Baraitha’ cf. Bomb. ed. Cur. edd. ‘our Mishnah’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Since the discharge does not originate from the woman's own body.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Of course it is. Why then did R. Samuel raise the question at all?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) Since the Rabbis ruled that uncleanness is conveyed internally as well as externally it is obvious that the woman is<br>regarded as one observing a discharge, and is, therefore, subject all the more to the other restrictions.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Even according to R. Simeon.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) Well knowing that no internal uncleanness is conveyed (cf. supra n. <sup>6</sup>).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Sc. as the man is free from internal uncleanness so is she.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) Since he regarded her only as one coming in contact with a discharge.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) And she is in all respects to be treated as such.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) V. supra p. <sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup><sup>8</sup> n. <sup>5</sup>.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) In reply to the objection, ‘Is it not logical that she should be regarded as coming in contact with one?’<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Not to approach the mountain.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) V.

Rabbah (Bah).<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) Lit., ‘spittle’, i.e., your opinions are all traceable to the same source.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) Sc. as the man is free from internal uncleanness so is she.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) Since in the case of the man also (to whose degree of uncleanness hers is compared) any previous counting is<br>rendered void and the smallest quantity conveys uncleanness.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) After one observation during her menstrual period.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) Cf. prev. n. mut. mut. If this single observation is followed by two other observations the woman is a confirmed<br>zabah and must count seven days before she attains to cleanness, but if no other observation followed she only awaits<br>one clean day for the unclean one.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) This is explained presently.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) Sc. as soon as the discharge made its way into the vagina.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lit ‘(almost) all of them’.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) And the discharge observed.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) Who was already specifically enumerated among the first three cases.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) Of the woman after childbirth.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup>) After the seven or fourteen days of uncleanness following the birth of a male and a female respectively.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup>) The period of thirty-three clean days after the seven, and the sixty-six clean days after the fourteen (cf. prev. n.).<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup>) The ruling that a woman in such circumstances contracts uncleanness internally.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>) In the vagina, where it remained for a day or two.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup>) Since the mere passing of the seven or fourteen days does not restore the woman to cleanness unless immersion had<br>been performed (cf. supra <sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>b). When the unclean blood (cf. next n.) is completely discharged from the body a second<br>immersion is required since no cleanness had been attained by the first.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup>) While the blood is retained in the vagina, on account of her carriage of, or contact with the detached blood in it.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup>) When, owing to the immersion, her clean period had already begun and the blood is clean. It has thus been shown<br>that the Baraitha under discussion is in agreement with the first case, ‘while she was going down, she is unclean’ of R.<br>Zera.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup>) Which (cf. Hul. <sup>7</sup><sup>1</sup>a) cannot convey uncleanness either through contact or through carriage. Granted that a<br>menstrual, or a zibah discharge causes a woman's uncleanness even while it is still absorbed in the vagina (as deduced<br>supra from a Scriptural text), how can this blood, which is neither menstrual nor one of zibah and which (if it had come<br>in external contact with the woman) could only have caused one day's uncleanness convey to the woman any<br>uncleanness at all while still absorbed?<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup>) As a mark of approval.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup>) Though it conveys no uncleanness to the garments of the man who comes in contact with it.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup>) Those of the man who eats of it.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup>) An ‘absorbed uncleanness’.",
        "seeing that in the latter case no uncleanness is conveyed by external contact<sup>1</sup> while here uncleanness<br>would be conveyed when it emerges from the body?<sup>2</sup> — Here also it is a case where the discharge<br>emerged from the body.<sup>3</sup> But if it emerged from the body, what need was there to mention such a<br>case?<sup>4</sup> — It might have been presumed that as the immersion is effective in respect of blood that is<br>internal it is also effective in respect of the other,<sup>5</sup> hence we were informed [that in the latter case the<br>immersion is of no avail]. The difficulty about our cited tradition<sup>6</sup> is well solved; but as regards the<br>woman after childbirth<sup>7</sup> [the difficulty arises again]: If the birth occurred during her menstruation<br>period she is a menstruant, and if it occurred during her zibah period she is a zabah?<sup>8</sup> — Here we are<br>dealing with the case of a dry birth.<sup>9</sup> But in the case of a dry birth,<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> what point is there in the<br>statement that uncleanness is contracted internally as well as externally?<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> — The statement is<br>justified in a case for instance, where the embryo put its head out of the ante-chamber;<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> and this<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> is<br>in agreement with R. Oshaia, for R. Oshaia stated, ‘This<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> is a preventive measure<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> against the<br>possibility that the embryo might put its head out of the ante-chamber’;<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> and this<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> is also in line<br>with the following ruling: A certain person once came before Raba and asked him, ‘Is it permissible<br>to perform a circumcision on the Sabbath?’ ‘This’, the other replied, ‘is quite in order’. After that<br>person went out Raba considered: Is it likely that this man did not know that it was permissible to<br>perform a circumcision on the Sabbath? He thereupon followed him and said to him, ‘Pray tell me all<br>the circumstance of the case’.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> ‘I’, the other told him, ‘heard the child cry late on the Sabbath eve<br>but it was not born until the Sabbath’. ‘This is a case’, the first explained to him, ‘of a child<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> who<br>put his head out of the ante-chamber<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> and consequently his circumcision<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> is one that does not take<br>place at the proper time,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> and on account of a circumcision that does not take place at the proper<br>time the Sabbath may not be desecrated.’<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> The question was raised: Is that region in a woman<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup><br>regarded as an absorbed place or as a concealed one? — In what respect could this matter? — In the<br>case, for instance, where her friend inserted in her in that region a piece of nebelah of the size of an<br>olive. If you say that it is regarded as an absorbed place, this nebelah being now an absorbed<br>uncleanness<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> would convey no uncleanness to the woman,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> but if you say that it is a concealed<br>place, granted that no uncleanness could be conveyed by means of contact<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> uncleanness would be<br>conveyed by means of carriage?<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> — Abaye replied: It is regarded as an absorbed place. Raba<br>replied: It is regarded as a concealed one. Said Raba: Whence do I derive this? From what was<br>taught: Since the uncleanness arises in a concealed region, and since an uncleanness in a concealed<br>region is elsewhere ineffective, a special Scriptural ordinance was required [to give it effect in this<br>particular case].<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> And Abaye?<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> — The meaning<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> is this: There is one reason and there is yet<br>another.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> In the first place the woman should be clean since the uncleanness is an absorbed one;<br>and, furthermore, even if you were to find some ground for saying that it is a concealed uncleanness<br>and an uncleanness in a concealed region is ineffective, this<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> is a specific Scriptural ordinance.<br>The question was raised: Is the region through which the nebelah of a clean bird conveys<br>uncleanness to a human being<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> regarded as an absorbed place or as a concealed one? In what<br>respect can this matter? — In a case, for instance, where his friend pushed a piece of nebelah of the<br>size of an olive into his mouth.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> If you regard it as an absorbent place, this nebelah being now an<br>absorbed uncleanness would convey no uncleanness, but if<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> you say that it is a concealed one,<br>granted that no uncleanness is conveyed by means of contact,<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> uncleanness would be conveyed by<br>means of carriage?<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> — Abaye replied: It is an absorbed place, but Raba replied: It is a concealed<br>one. Whence, said Abaye, do I derive this? From what was taught: As it might have been presumed<br>that the nebelah of a beast conveys uncleanness to a person's garments by way of his oesophagus,<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> it<br>was explicitly stated in Scripture, That which dieth of itself,<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> or is torn of beasts, he shall not eat to<br>defile himself therewith,<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> which implies: Only that<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> which has no other form of uncleanness but<br>that which is conveyed through the eating thereof<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> [conveys uncleanness by way of the<br>oesophagus],<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> but this<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> is excluded since it conveys uncleanness even before one had eaten of it.<br>But why should not this<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> be inferred a minori ad majus from the nebelah of a clean bird: If the<br>nebelah of a clean bird which is not subject to uncleanness externally is subject to uncleanness<br>internally<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> how much more then should this,<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> which is subject to uncleanness externally, be subject<br>to uncleanness internally? — Scripture said, ‘therewith’<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> which implies: Only therewith<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> but not<br>with any other.<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> If so, why was it stated in Scripture, And he that eateth?<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> To prescribe for one who<br>touches or carries it the same size as that which was prescribed for one who eats of it: As one who<br>eats of it incurs guilt on consuming the full size of an olive so also one who touches or carries it<br>contracts uncleanness only if it is of the size of an olive.<br>Raba ruled: A man holding a dead creeping thing in a fold of his body<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> is clean, but if he holds<br>nebelah in a fold of his body he is unclean. ‘A man holding a dead creeping thing in a fold of his<br>body is clean’, since a dead creeping thing conveys uncleanness by means of touch, while a<br>concealed region of the body<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> is not susceptible to the uncleanness of touch. ‘If he holds nebelah in<br>a fold of his body he is unclean’ for, granted that he contracts no uncleanness through touch, he<br>contracts it, at any rate, through carriage. If a man held a dead creeping thing in the fold of his<br>body<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> and he thus brought it into the air spaces<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> of an oven<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> the latter is unclean. Is not this<br>obvious?<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> — It might have been presumed that the All Merciful said, Into the inside of which,<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup><br>implying:<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Cf. prev. n. but two.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) From which it is evident that it is rather like other kinds of uncleanness. Why then should it be different from those in<br>conveying uncleanness even while in an absorbed condition?<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Sc. if the blood was detached before the immersion the woman becomes unclean after, but not before its complete<br>emergence.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Apparently none, since it is obvious that unclean blood conveys uncleanness when it emerges from the body.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) That was detached and remained for a time within the vagina.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) R. Zera's ruling.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Included in the Baraitha under discussion, which can now no longer be compared with the ruling of R. Zera.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Cf. relevant notes supra <sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>a ad fin.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) And one that was free from bleeding: so that the question of menstrual, or zibah blood does not arise.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Where there is no detached blood either within or without.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) How can there be uncleanness in the absence of all blood?<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) And then draw it back (cf. Strashun). Although the head is now within (internal) the woman is unclean as if the<br>embryo had actually been born (external).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) The ruling that the projection of the head of the embryo without the ante-chamber is regarded as birth.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) That a midwife is unclean for seven days if she touched a dead embryo before it was extracted, though its mother<br>remains clean until extraction had been effected.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) Enacted by the Rabbis. Pentateuchally the embryo, being at the time an ‘absorbed uncleanness’, would convey no<br>uncleanness at all.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Hul. <sup>7</sup><sup>2</sup>a; and the midwife would then touch it when, having touched a corpse, her uncleanness would be<br>Pentateuchal. Thus it follows that according to R. Oshaia the projection of the embryo's head without the ante-chamber is<br>regarded as the actual birth. Similarly in the case under discussion, as soon as the embryo had put its head out of the<br>ante-chamber its mother is subject to the uncleanness of birth as if the birth had taken place.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) V. supra n. <sup>2</sup>.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Lit., ‘how was the body of the incident?’<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Whose cry could be heard.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) On the Friday, when he was heard crying.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) On any day after the following Friday which is the eighth day of his virtual birth.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Circumcision being due on the eighth day of birth.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) The circumcision must, therefore, be postponed until the Sunday. At all events, Raba's ruling shows that the<br>projection of the embryo's head without the ante-chamber is regarded as birth (cf. supra n. <sup>2</sup>).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Euphemism.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) And, therefore, regarded as non-existent.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Either through contact or carriage (cf. prev. n.).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) The uncleanness by contact not applying to a concealed region of the body.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) Since the woman was carrying the nebelah.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) Supra <sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>b q.v. notes.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) How can he maintain his view in contradiction to Raba's citation?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Of the cited statement.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) Lit., ‘one and more he says’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) The woman's uncleanness (cf. supra n. <sup>5</sup>).<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) Sc. the oesophagus.

        "But not the inside of its inside,<sup>1</sup> hence we were informed [that the oven is unclean].<sup>2</sup><br>Resh Lakish ruled: If a reed was held in a fold of the body of a zab and he shook therewith a clean<br>person the latter remains clean.<sup>3</sup> If a reed was held in the fold of the body of a clean person and he<br>shook therewith a zab the former is unclean.<sup>4</sup> What is the reason?<sup>5</sup> Because Scripture said, And<br>whomsoever he that hath issue<sup>6</sup> toucheth, without having rinsed his hands in water,<sup>7</sup> and this<sup>8</sup> refers<br>to the shaking of a zab, a form of conveyance of uncleanness the like of which we do not find<br>anywhere in all the Torah; and the All Merciful expressed this in the term of touching,<sup>9</sup> in order to<br>tell that shaking and touching must be performed with a part of the body which is like one's hands; as<br>one's hands are exposed<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> so must any other part of the body<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> be exposed.<br>BUT A ZAB AND ONE WHO EMITTED SEMEN CONVEY NO UNCLEANNESS etc. A ZAB,<br>because it is written in Scripture, When any man hath an issue out of his flesh,<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> [which implies that<br>no uncleanness is conveyed] unless his issue emerged ‘out of his flesh’; ONE WHO EMITTED<br>SEMEN, because It is written, And if the flow of seed go out from a man.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup><br>IF A MAN WAS EATING TERUMAH WHEN HE FELT etc. Was it not, however, taught: R.<br>Eliezer stated, whoever holds his membrum when he makes water is as though he had brought a<br>flood on the world?<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> — Abaye replied: One does it with a thick rag.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> Raba stated: It may even be<br>done with a soft rag, for once the semen has been detached the subsequent touch is of no<br>consequence.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> And Abaye?<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> — He takes into consideration the possibility of an additional<br>discharge. And Raba? — He does not consider the possibility of an additional discharge. But does he<br>not?<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> Was it not in fact taught: ‘To what may this be compared? To the putting of a finger upon the<br>eye when, so long as the finger remains on it, the eye continues to tear’? Now Raba?<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> — It is<br>unusual to get heated twice in immediate succession.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup><br>Samuel ruled, Any semen the emission of which is not felt throughout one's body causes no<br>uncleanness. What is the reason? — The All Merciful has said, The flow of seed,<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> implying that the<br>text<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> deals only with such as is fit to produce seed. An objection was raised: If a man was troubled<br>with unchaste thoughts in the night and when he rose up he found his flesh heated, he is unclean!<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup><br>— R. Huna explained this to apply to a man who dreamt of indulging in sexual intercourse, it being<br>impossible to indulge in the act without experiencing the sensation. Another rendering: Samuel<br>ruled, Any semen which does not shoot forth like an arrow causes no uncleanness. What is the<br>practical difference between the latter reading and the former reading? — The practical difference<br>between them is the case where the detachment of the semen was perceived but the emergence was<br>not felt.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> Now this ruling which was quite obvious to Samuel was a matter of enquiry for Raba. For<br>Raba enquired: What is the law where the detachment of the semen was perceived but its emergence<br>was not felt?<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> — Come and hear: If a man who emitted semen performed immersion<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> before he<br>had made water, his uncleanness is resumed when he makes water!<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> — There it is different, since<br>the emergence of most of the semen was perceived. Others have a different reading: Samuel ruled,<br>Any semen which does not shoot forth like an arrow causes no fructification. It is only fructification<br>that it does not cause but it does cause uncleanness, for it is said in Scripture. If there be among you<br>any man, that is not clean by reason of that which chanceth him,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> which implies: Even a chance<br>emission<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> whatever its nature.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup><br>Raba enquired: What is the law where an idolater indulged in sexual thoughts,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> and then<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> he<br>went down and performed ritual immersion?<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> If you were to find some case where we follow the<br>time of detachment<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> [the question would arise]. Does this apply only where the law is thereby<br>restricted,<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> but not here<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> where the law would thereby be relaxed,<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> or is it possible that no<br>distinction is made? — This is undecided.<br>Raba enquired: What is the ruling where the urine of a zabah had been detached from the source<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup><br>and then she went down and performed ritual immersion?<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> If you were to find some case where we<br>follow the time of the detachment [the question would arise], Does this apply only to semen, since it<br>cannot be restrained,<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> but not to her urine which she is able to restrain,<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> or is it possible that no<br>distinction is made? — This is undecided.<br>Raba enquired: What is the law where the urine of an idolatress<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> who was a zabah had been<br>detached<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Inside, for instance, an arm-pit which is inside the oven.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) The implication, ‘but not the inside of its inside’ excludes only the case where a creeping thing was within a vessel<br>whose rim and mouth projected above the vessel in which it was contained.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) The reason is given presently.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Since he ‘carried’ the zab.

Nathan. For it was taught: R. Nathan citing R. Ishmael ruled,<br>[the discharge of] a zab<sup>4</sup> must be such a quantity as would stop the orifice of the membrum; but [the<br>Rabbis] did not agree with him.<sup>7</sup> What is R. Ishmael's reason? — Because Scripture said, Or his<br>flesh be stopped from his issue.<sup>5</sup> And the Rabbis?<sup>8</sup> — That text<sup>9</sup> is required for the inference that the<br>discharge conveys uncleanness only when in a state of fluidity<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> but not when it is dry.<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> And R.<br>Ishmael?<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> — That<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> is inferred from run.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> And the Rabbis?<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> — That text<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> serves the purpose of<br>indicating the number:<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> His issue,<sup>9</sup> implies once; His flesh run,<sup>9</sup> implies twice; With his issue,<sup>9</sup><br>implies three times; thus it was taught that a zab who observed three discharges is under an<br>obligation to bring a sacrifice; Or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness,<sup>9</sup> implies<br>that he is unclean even on account of a part of the number of his issues,<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> this teaches that a zab who<br>observed only two discharges conveys uncleanness to his couch and seat. As to R. Ishmael,<br>however,<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> whence does he deduce the number required?<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> — He derives it from an exposition of R.<br>Simai; for it was taught: R. Simai stated, Scripture enumerated two issues and described the man as<br>unclean<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> and it also enumerated three issues and described the man as unclean,<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> how is this to be<br>reconciled? Two observations subject a man to the restrictions of uncleanness, and three<br>observations render him liable to bring a sacrifice. But according to the Rabbis<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> who deduced both<br>numbers from ‘This shall be his uncleanness in his issue’,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> what deduction do they make from the<br>text ‘when any man hath an issue out of his flesh’?<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> — They require it for the deduction that<br>uncleanness does not begin until the discharge emerged from one's flesh. What need, however, was<br>there for ‘His issue be unclean’?<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> — ‘This teaches that the issue itself<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> is unclean.<br>R. Hanilai citing R. Eliezer son of R. Simeon ruled: Semen conveys uncleanness to the man who<br>emitted it,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> however small its quantity, but as regards the man who touched it its quantity must be of<br>the bulk of a lentil.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> But did we not learn, AND THE DISCHARGES CONVEY UNCLEANNESS,<br>HOWEVER SMALL THE QUANTITY, which applies, does it not, to the case of one who touched<br>semen? — No, it applies only to one who emitted it.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup><br>Come and hear: In one respect the law of semen is more restrictive than that of a dead creeping<br>thing while in another respect the law of a dead creeping thing is more restrictive than that of semen.<br>‘The law of a dead creeping thing is more restrictive’ in that no distinction [of age] is made about its<br>uncleanness,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> which is not the case with semen.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> ‘The law of semen is more restrictive’ in that<br>uncleanness is conveyed by its smallest quantity, which is not the case with a creeping thing.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> Now<br>does not this apply to one who touched the semen?<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> — No, it applies only to one who emitted it.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup><br>But was it not taught as being on a par with the creeping thing: As the latter is a case of touching so<br>also the former?<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> — R. Adda b. Ahabah replied: The ruling referred to a creeping thing in general<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup><br>and to semen in general.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> But does a creeping thing convey no uncleanness even when it is of the<br>smallest bulk? Have we not in fact learnt: Members of the body<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> have<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> no prescribed minimum<br>size [and uncleanness is, therefore, conveyed] by less than the size of an olive of corpse,<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> by less<br>than the size of an olive of nebelah or by less than the size of a lentil of a dead creeping thing?<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> —<br>It is different with a member of the body<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> since the whole of it takes the place of the size of a lentil;<br>for were any part of it<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> missing,<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> would the member<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> have conveyed any uncleanness?<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> What is<br>meant by the ‘distinction in uncleanness’ in the case of semen? If it be suggested: The distinction<br>between the semen of an Israelite and that of foreigners [it could be objected]: Is there not in this<br>case also<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> a distinction between a sea-mouse and a land-mouse?<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> — The distinction rather is that<br>between a minor and an adult.<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup><br>R. Papa stated: This ruling<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> is a point at issue between Tannas:<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> [For it was taught] whence do<br>we derive the inclusion in uncleanness of one who touched semen? From Scripture which explicitly<br>stated, Or whosoever;<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> and elsewhere Tannas differ on a relevant point,<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> for there are those who<br>hold that a deduction is carried through in all respects<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> while others hold that a deduction is limited<br>by its original basis.<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> Now according to those who hold that a deduction is carried through in all<br>respects<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> it follows that as a dead creeping thing<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> conveys uncleanness through touch so does<br>semen convey uncleanness by touch and, consequently,<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> as a dead creeping thing conveys<br>uncleanness only when it is of the bulk of a lentil so does semen convey uncleanness only when it is<br>of the bulk of a lentil; while according to him who maintained that a deduction is limited by its<br>original basis<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> it also follows that as a dead creeping thing conveys uncleanness through touch so<br>does semen convey uncleanness through touch, but then, limiting it to its original basis, as semen<br>conveys uncleanness to the man who emitted it, however small its quantity, so does it also convey<br>uncleanness to the man who touched it, however small its quantity.<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> Said<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> R. Huna son of R.<br>Nathan to R. Papa: Whence the proof that the inclusion in uncleanness of one who touched semen is<br>deduced from the expression of ‘Or whosoever occurring in the context dealing with the creeping<br>thing?<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> Is it not possible that the inclusion is derived from the expression of ‘Or from whomsoever<br>the flow of seed goeth out,<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> and<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> all may be of the opinion that a deduction is to be carried through<br>in all respects?<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> The Tannas<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> were asked<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> Some recited as R.

For the Rabbis taught: When any man,<sup>9</sup> what was the object of stating, ‘When any man’?<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> To<br>include a boy one day old in the restrictions of the uncleanness of zibah; so R. Judah. R. Ishmael son<br>of R. Johanan b. Beroka said, This deduction is not necessary, for surely it is stated in Scripture, And<br>of them that have an issue, whether it be a man or a woman;<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> ‘whether it be a man’ means one of<br>any age, whether adult or minor, ‘or a woman means one of any age, whether an adult or minor.

For the<br>All Merciful has said, And have no child,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> but she has one. But what was the point of speaking of a<br>‘child’ seeing that the same applies even to an embryo, for it is written,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> As in her youth,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> which<br>excludes<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> one who is pregnant?<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> Both texts were required. For if the All Merciful had only written,<br>‘And have no child’ [it might have been presumed that the law<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> applied to that case] because<br>originally there was but one body and now there are two bodies,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> but that in this case,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> where there<br>was originally one body and now also there is only one body, it may be held that the woman may eat<br>terumah, hence the All Merciful has written, ‘As in her youth’.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> And if the All Merciful has only<br>written, ‘As in her youth’ [it might have been presumed that the law<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> applied to that case alone]<br>since originally the woman's body was empty and now it is a full one, but that in this case,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> where<br>her body was originally empty and is now also empty, the woman may well eat terumah. Hence the<br>necessity for both texts. Now, the Scriptural texts have been well explained, but as regards our<br><b>MISHNAH</b>, why just A BOY ONE DAY OLD, seeing<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> that even an embryo also disqualifies its<br>mother? — R. Shesheth replied: We are here dealing with the case of a priest who had two wives,<br>one who had previously been a divorced woman<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> and the other was not a divorced woman,<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> and he<br>had sons from the latter<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> and one son from the former,<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> so that the latter<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> causes the slaves of his<br>father<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> to be disqualified from eating terumah;<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> thus indicating that the law is contrary to the<br>view<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> of R.

Our Rabbis taught: A girl of the age of three years may be betrothed by intercourse; so<br>R. Meir. But the Sages say: Only one who is three years and one day old. What is the practical<br>difference between them? — The school of R Jannai replied: The practical difference between them<br>is the day preceding the first day of the fourth year.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> R. Johanan, however, replied: The practical<br>difference between them is the rule that thirty days of a year are counted as the full year.<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup><br>An objection was raised: A girl of the age of three years and even one of the age of two years and<br>one day may be betrothed by intercourse; so R. Meir. But the Sages say: Only one who is three years<br>and one day old.<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Sc. after his death.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) That an embryo dies before its mother.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) After its mother was dead.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) But are no signs of life.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) The law that A BOY ONE DAY OLD... TRANSMITS.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) If, for instance, there were two brothers other than the boy in question, and one of them was the firstborn, the estate<br>is divided, not into three portions (two for the ordinary portions of the two brothers and one for the birthright), but into<br>four portions. Each brother, including the young child, receives one such portion and the firstborn receives the additional<br>fourth portion as his birthright. The firstborn thus receives, as the portion of his birthright, a quarter of the estate, and not<br>(as would have been the case if the child were excluded) a third.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Though he receives his due portion in the estate. In the case mentioned as an instance in the prev. n. the estate would<br>first be divided into three portions (as if the embryo did not exist) and the firstborn would receive, as his birthright, one<br>of these, which represents a third of the estate. The remaining two thirds would then be divided into three equal shares,<br>each of the three brothers receiving one, I.e., two ninths of the estate. The full portion of the firstborn would accordingly<br>amount to (<sup>1</sup>/<sup>3</sup> + <sup>2</sup>/<sup>9</sup> = <sup>5</sup>/<sup>9</sup>) five ninths of the estate, while, where the child was one day old, the firstborn's full portion<br>would only amount to half the estate, i.e., (<sup>5</sup>/<sup>9</sup> — <sup>1</sup>/<sup>2</sup> = <sup>1</sup>/<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) one eighteenth less.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) That a born child does, and an embryo does not cause a diminution in the portion of the birthright.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Deut. XXI, <sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>, emphasis on ‘him’, sc. while the father is alive. An embryo cannot come within the category of ‘have<br>born’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) The version just given.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) In the case, for instance, where his widow bore twins, or where he was survived by two widows and both bore sons<br>and one of these was the firstborn.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Deut.

Simeon b. Gamaliel, must it not?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) In our Mishnah.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Lit., ‘whose months have ended’. The child's viability is beyond question even according to R. Simeon b. Gamaliel<br>who (cf. p. <sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup><sup>7</sup>, n. <sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) referred only to a doubtful premature birth.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) Subject to her father's approval.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) The brother of her deceased childless husband, whose duty it is to contract the levirate marriage with her.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) In consequence of which he gains possession of his deceased brother's estate, is entitled if she dies to inherit her<br>own estate and even if he is a priest, he may defile himself to her as to a legally married wife.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Punishable by death.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) Lit., ‘on account of the wife of a man’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) If, for instance, her father betrothed her to one man and another cohabited with her.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) When a menstruant.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) Lit., ‘lower couch’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Lit., ‘like the upper’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) A bastard or a slave, for instance.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) Sc. if she was the daughter of a priest she loses the privilege of eating terumah.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) Being a minor.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) Lit., ‘the eve of the beginning of the year’. According to R. Meir she attains the prescribed age on that day while<br>according to the Rabbis she does not attain it until the following day.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) According to R. Meir the prescribed age is attained as soon as thirty days of the third year have passed, while<br>according to the Rabbis it is not attained until the first day of the fourth year.",
        "Now, all is well according to R. Johanan, for just as there is a Tanna<sup>1</sup> who holds<sup>2</sup> that one day of a<br>year is counted as a year so there may also be a Tanna who holds<sup>3</sup> that thirty days of a year are<br>counted as a full year; but, according to R. Jannai,<sup>4</sup> does not this<sup>5</sup> present a difficulty? — This is a<br>difficulty.<br>IF ONE WAS YOUNGER THAN THIS AGE, INTERCOURSE WITH HER IS LIKE PUTTING<br>A FINGER IN THE EYE. It was asked, Do the features of virginity<sup>6</sup> disappear<sup>7</sup> and reappear again<sup>8</sup><br>or is it possible that they cannot be completely destroyed until after the third year of her age? In what<br>practical respect could this matter? — In one, for instance, where her husband had intercourse with<br>her before the age of<sup>9</sup> three and found blood, and when he had intercourse after the age of three he<br>found no blood. If you grant that they disappear and reappear again [it might well be assumed]<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup><br>that<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> there ‘was not sufficient time for their reappearance, but if you maintain that they cannot be<br>destroyed until after the age of three years it would be obvious that<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> a stranger cohabited with her.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup><br>Now what is your decision? — R. Hiyya son of R. Ika demurred: But who can tell us that a wound<br>inflicted within the three years is not healed<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> forthwith, seeing it is possible that it is immediately<br>healed and it would thus be obvious<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> that a stranger had cohabited with her?<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> Rather the practical<br>difference is the case, for instance, where her husband had intercourse with her while she was<br>under<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> three years of age and found blood and when he had intercourse after the age of three he also<br>found blood. If you grant that the features disappear and reappear again the blood might well be<br>treated as that of virginity, but if you maintain that they cannot be destroyed until after the age of<br>three years, that<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> must be the blood of menstruation. Now what is your decision? — R. Hisda<br>replied, Come and hear: IF ONE WAS YOUNGER THAN THIS AGE, INTERCOURSE WITH<br>HER IS LIKE PUTTING A FINGER IN THE EYE; what need was there to state, LIKE PUTTING<br>A FINGER IN THE EYE’ instead of merely saying: IF ONE WAS YOUNGER THAN THIS AGE,<br>INTERCOURSE WITH HER IS of no consequence’? Does not this then teach us that as the eye<br>tears and tears again so do the features of virginity disappear and reappear again.<br>Our Rabbis taught: It is related of Justinia<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> the daughter of ‘Aseverus son of Antonius that she<br>once appeared before Rabbi ‘Master’, she laid to him, ‘at what age may a woman marry?’. ‘At the<br>age of three years and one day’, he told her. ‘And at what age is she capable of conception?’ ‘At the<br>age of twelve years and one day’, he replied. ‘I’, she said to him, ‘married at the age of six and bore<br>a child at the age of seven; alas for the three years that I have lost at my father's house’. But can a<br>woman conceive at the age of six years? Did not R. Bibi recite in the presence of R. Nahman: Three<br>classes of woman may use an absorbent<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> in their marital intercourse:<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> A minor, and an expectant<br>and a nursing mother. The minor,<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> because otherwise she might become pregnant and die. An<br>expectant mother,<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> because otherwise she might cause her foetus to degenerate into a sandal.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> A<br>nursing mother,<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> because otherwise she might have to wean her child prematurely,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> and this would<br>result in his death. And what is the age of such a ‘minor’?<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> From the age of eleven years and one<br>day to the age of twelve years and one day. One who is under<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> or over this age<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> must carry on her<br>marital intercourse in a normal manner; so R. Meir. But the Sages ruled: The one as well as the other<br>carries on her marital intercourse in a normal manner and mercy<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> will be vouchsafed from heaven,<br>for it is said in Scripture, The Lord preserveth the simple?<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> — If you wish I might reply: Whose<br>flesh is as the flesh of asses.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> And if you prefer I might reply: Whose mouth speaketh falsehood,<br>and their right hand is a right hand of lying.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: A story is told of a certain woman who came before R. Akiba and said to him,<br>‘Master, intercourse has been forced upon me<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> when I was under<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> three years of age; what is my<br>position towards the priesthood?’<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> ‘You are fit for the priesthood’,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> he replied. ‘Master’, she<br>continued, ‘I will give you a comparison; to what may the incident be compared? To a babe whose<br>finger was submerged<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> in honey. The first time and the second time he cries about it, but the third<br>time he sucks it’.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> ‘If so’, he replied, ‘you are unfit for the priesthood’.<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> Observing that the<br>students were looking at each other,<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> he said to them, ‘Why do you find the ruling difficult?’<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup><br>‘Because’, they replied, ‘as all the Torah is a tradition that was handed to Moses at Sinai so is the<br>law that a girl under the age of three years<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> is fit for the priesthood one that was handed to Moses at<br>Sinai’. R. Akiba too made his statement<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> only for the purpose of exercising the wits of<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> the<br>students.<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup><br><b>MISHNAH</b>.

Eleazar stated, The age limits<br>that were assigned to the girl apply to the boy while those assigned to the boy apply to the girl.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> R.<br>Hisda stated: What is Rabbi's reason? Because it is written in Scripture, And the Lord God built<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> the<br>rib<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> which teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, endowed the woman with more<br>understanding<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> than the man. And the other?<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> — He requires that text<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> for the same deduction as<br>the one made by Resh Lakish, for Resh Lakish citing R. Simeon b. Menasya stated, And the lord<br>God built the rib which he took from the man into a woman, and he brought her unto the man,<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup><br>teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, plaited Eve's hair and then brought her to Adam, for in the<br>sea-towns they describe net-work as binyatha.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> But what is R. Simeon b. Eleazar's reason? — R.<br>Samuel son of R. Isaac replied: As a boy frequents the house of his teacher his subtlety<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> develops<br>earlier.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup><br>It was asked: Is the intervening period<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> regarded as that of under, or of over age?<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> — In respect<br>of what law could this matter: If in that of vows, it is neither regarded as that of under age nor as that<br>of over age?<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> — Rather in respect of punishments.<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> Now what is the ruling? — Both Rab and R.<br>Hanina replied: The intervening period is regarded as that of under age.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> Both R. Johanan and R.<br>Joshua b. Levi replied: The intervening period is regarded as that of over age. Said R. Nahman b.<br>Isaac: Your mnemonic<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> is: Now this was the custom in former time in Israel.<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup><br>R. Hamnuna raised an objection:<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> SUBSEQUENT TO THIS AGE, EVEN THOUGH THEY<br>SAID, WE DO NOT KNOW IN HONOUR OF WHOSE NAME WE HAVE MADE OUR VOW’<br>OR ‘IN HONOUR OF WHOSE NAME WE HAVE MADE OUR DEDICATION’ THEIR VOW IS<br>A VALID VOW AND THEIR DEDICATION IS A VALID DEDICATION. Thus<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> it follows, does<br>it not, that the intervening period is regarded as that of under age? Said Raba to him, Read then the<br>first clause: PRIOR TO THIS AGE, EVEN THOUGH THEY SAID, ‘WE KNEW IN HONOUR OF<br>WHOSE NAME WE HAVE MADE OUR VOW’ OR ‘IN HONOUR OF WHOSE NAME WE<br>HAVE MADE OUR DEDICATION’, THEIR VOW IS NO VALID VOW AND THEIR<br>DEDICATION IS NO VALID DEDICATION. Thus<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> it follows, does it not, that the intervening<br>period is regarded as that of over age? — This, however, is no argument, Raba having laboured<br>under a misapprehension. He thought that R. Hamnuna drew his inference from a Mishnah<br>redundancy,<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> [hence he argued that] instead of drawing an inference from the final clause he might<br>as well have drawn one from the first clause; but this was not the case. R. Hamnuna in fact drew his<br>inference from the very wording<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> of our Mishnah. How [he reasoned] is one to understand the<br>expression of ‘SUBSEQUENT TO THAT AGE’? If by that time one had not yet grown two hairs,<br>one would, surely, still be a minor.<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> Consequently it must refer to one who had grown two hairs,<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Thus, being of age, affecting valid kinyan of marriage.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Being now in all respects her lawful husband, halizah is no longer necessary.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) To ascertain whether the girl was aware of their significance.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) No examination being necessary.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Cf. prev. n. but one, mut. mut.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) The first day of the twelfth year in the case of a girl and the first day of the thirteenth year in that of a boy.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Since they are still minors.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Twelve years and a day in the case of a girl and thirteen years and a day in that of a boy when they respectively attain<br>their majority.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) From which it might well be inferred that at a later age her vows are valid and no examination is necessary.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) And that the age of eleven years and one day is only the limit below which even an examination does not establish<br>the validity of a vow.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) And it has previously been stated that from the age of eleven years and one day vows must be examined.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) A ruling which evidently follows (cf. prev. n.) from the previous statements.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) The first of the twelfth year.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Thus revealing her mental incapacity.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) During the remaining months of that year.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) On the assumption that the examinations during the thirty days have established for the rest of that year that her<br>mental state was that of a minor.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) In view of the explicit statement that examinations are conducted throughout the twelfth year.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) And if she shows sufficient mental development her vows are valid even at that early age.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) In view of the earlier statements.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) On the limits of minority and majority.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Sc. they do not claim ‘we know’ when they are under the age limit or ‘we do not know’ when they are above the<br>limit.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Cf.

        "the reason for the ruling<sup>1</sup> being that one was over age, when all requirements<sup>2</sup> were satisfied.<sup>3</sup> Thus<br>it follows, does it not, that the intervening period<sup>4</sup> is regarded as that of under age?<sup>5</sup> A further<br>objection was [also] raised by R. Zera: When . . . man . . . shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of . . .<sup>6</sup><br>What was the purpose of stating ‘man’? To include in the scope of the law a boy of the age of<br>thirteen years and one day whose vows are valid, though he is unable to ‘utter clearly’. Now how is<br>this to be understood? If it be suggested that the reference is to a boy who had not yet grown two<br>hairs, [the objection could be raised:] Such a boy would still have the status of a minor.<sup>7</sup> The<br>reference consequently must be to one who had grown two hairs, the reason being that he is thirteen<br>years and one day old, when he is regarded as a ‘man’. Thus<sup>8</sup> it follows, does it not, that the<br>intervening period is regarded as that of under age?<sup>9</sup> — This is indeed a refutation.<br>R. Nahman stated, The question<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> is a point at issue between Tannas:<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> [For it was taught:] If a<br>boy of the age of seven years grew two hairs they are attributed to a mole;<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> from the age of nine<br>years to that of twelve years and one day they are also to be attributed to a mole,<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> but R. Jose son of<br>R. Judah ruled: They<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> are a sign of puberty; at the age of thirteen years and one day, all agree that<br>they are a sign of puberty.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> Now is not this self-contradictory: You said, ‘From the age of nine years<br>to that of twelve years and one day they are also to be attributed to a mole’, from which it follows<br>that at the actual age of thirteen years they are a sign of puberty; but then it is stated, ‘At the age of<br>thirteen years and one day . . . they are a sign of puberty’, from which it follows, does it not, that at<br>the actual age of thirteen years they are to be attributed to a mole? Must you not concede then that<br>this question<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> is a point at issue between the Tannas, one Master<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> holding that the intervening<br>period is regarded as that of over age while the other Master maintains that the intervening period is<br>regarded as that of under age?<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> No; all may agree that the intervening period is regarded as that<br>under age, but both clauses refer to a girl the first<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> supporting the view of Rabbi<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> while the latter<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup><br>represents that of R. Simeon b. Eleazar.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> And if you prefer I<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> might reply: Both clauses refer to a<br>boy, and the first represents the view of R. Simeon b. Eleazar while the latter represents the view of<br>Rabbi.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> And if you prefer I<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> might reply: Both clauses are the view of Rabbi, but one<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> refers to a<br>boy while the other<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> refers to a girl. And if you prefer I<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> might say: Both clauses are the view of R.<br>Simeon b. Eleazar, but the one<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> refers to a boy while the other<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> refers to a girl.<br>‘R. Jose son of R. Judah ruled: They are a sign of puberty.’ R. Keruspedai son of R. Shabbethai<br>explained: This applies only where they<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> are still on him.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> So it was also taught: If a boy of the age<br>of nine years and one day had grown two hairs they are to be attributed to a mole; from the age of<br>nine years to that of twelve years and one day, though the hairs are still on him, they are to be<br>attributed to a mole. R. Jose son of R. Judah ruled: They are a sign of puberty.<br>Raba stated: The law is that the intervening period is regarded as that of under age. R. Samuel b.<br>Zutra taught Raba's tradition in the following form:<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> Raba stated, A minor all through her twelfth<br>year may make a declaration of mi'un<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> and go away,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> but from that age upwards she may not make<br>a declaration of mi'un<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> but<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> she may not submit to halizah.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> Is not this statement, however, self<br>contradictory? You said, ‘she may not make a declaration of mi'un’ from which it is evident that<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup><br>she is regarded as one of age; but if she is of age why may she not submit to halizah? And were you<br>to reply that he<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> was in doubt,<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> [it could be retorted:] Was he in doubt? Did not Raba in fact rule: A<br>minor on attaining the age of majority need not be examined<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> since there is presumption that she<br>has grown the signs of puberty? — This<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> applies only to general cases, but not here where an<br>examination was held and no hairs were found. If so,<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> why should she not be allowed to make a<br>declaration of mi'un? The possibility is taken into consideration that they might have fallen off. This<br>would be a satisfactory explanation according to him who holds that such a possibility is taken into<br>consideration, but what explanation can be offered according to him who holds that such a<br>possibility need not be taken into consideration? Was it not stated: R. Kahana<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> ruled, There is no<br>need to consider the possibility that they may have fallen off and R. Papi ruled, The possibility must<br>be considered? — This<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> applies only to the matter of halizah,<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> but as regards mi'un the possibility<br>is taken into consideration.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> Thus it follows that according to him who holds that the possibility<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> is<br>taken into consideration she may submit to halizah; but [it may be objected:] Did he not merely say<br>that the possibility<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> is taken into consideration?<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> The fact is that this<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> is a case where she was not<br>examined,<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> but the possibility<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> is taken into consideration as regards halizah,<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> and when Raba<br>stated ‘There is presumption’ he meant it in regard to mi'un,<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> but in regard to halizah<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> an<br>examination<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> is a pre-requisite. R. Dimi of Nehardea stated: The law is that the possibility that the<br>hairs may have fallen off is taken into consideration.<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> This,<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> however, applies only where one had<br>betrothed her<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> during the intervening period and cohabited after that period, since a Pentateuchal<br>doubt is thereby involved,<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> but not to the original betrothal alone.<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup><br>R. Huna ruled: If [a child]<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> dedicated some food and then ate it, he<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> is subject to flogging, for it<br>is said in Scripture, When... man . . . shall clearly utter a vow,<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> and He shall not break his word,<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup><br>which<sup>6</sup><sup>4</sup> implies that whosoever is able to ‘utter clearly’<sup>6</sup><sup>5</sup> is subject to the prohibition of ‘he shall not<br>break his word’<sup>6</sup><sup>6</sup> and only he who is not able to ‘utter clearly’ is not subject to the injunction of ‘he<br>shall not break his word’. R. Huna b. Judah addressed an objection to<sup>6</sup><sup>7</sup> Raba<sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup> in support of R.<br>Huna:<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Cf. prev. n.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Age and external marks of puberty.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘when the thing was completed’.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) When the prescribed age limit had not yet been reached.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) An objection against R.

        "Since we find that Scripture has put a minor on a par with an adult<sup>1</sup> as regards a presumptuous oath,<br>a self-imposed prohibition<sup>2</sup> and [the injunction] not to break his word, it might have been presumed<br>that he should also incur the liability of a sacrifice for eating that which he had dedicated, hence it<br>was explicitly stated,<sup>3</sup> This is the thing.<sup>4</sup> At any rate, was it not here stated that guilt was incurred for<br>infringing a self imposed prohibition or [the injunction] not to break one's word?<sup>5</sup> Read: The<br>prohibition<sup>6</sup> not to break his word.<sup>7</sup> [You say,] ‘The prohibition not to break his word’! Whatever<br>your assumption may be [a difficulty arises]. If an intelligent minor<sup>8</sup> approaching manhood is<br>Pentateuchally forbidden to break his word, he should also incur the penalty of flogging;<sup>9</sup> and if an<br>intelligent minor approaching manhood is not Pentateuchally forbidden to do it, there should not<br>be<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> even a mere prohibition?<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> — The prohibition<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> applies to those who are responsible for him.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup><br>May it then be inferred from this ruling<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> that if a minor eats nebelah<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> it is the duty of Beth din to<br>take it away from him?<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> Here we may be dealing with a case, for instance, where the minor<br>dedicated the food and others<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> ate it.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> This explanation is quite satisfactory according to him who<br>laid down that if a minor dedicated some food and others<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> ate it the latter are to be flogged, but what<br>can be said in explanation according to him who ruled that they were not to be flogged; for it was<br>stated: If a minor dedicated some food and others ate it, R. Kahana ruled, They are not to be flogged,<br>while both R. Johanan and Resh Lakish ruled, They are to be flogged? — The prohibition<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> is<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup><br>merely Rabbinical<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> and the Scriptural text<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> serves as a mere prop.<br>[Reverting to] the above text, ‘If a minor dedicated some food and others ate it, R. Kahana ruled,<br>They are not to be flogged, while both R. Johanan and Resh Lakish ruled, They are to be flogged’.<br>On what principle do they differ? — The Masters<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> are of the opinion that an intelligent minor<br>approaching manhood is under a Pentateuchal obligation<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> while the Master<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> is of the opinion that<br>an intelligent minor approaching manhood is only under a Rabbinical obligation.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> R. Jeremiah<br>raised an objection: If a fatherless girl<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> made a vow, her husband may disallow it for her. Now if<br>you grant that an intelligent minor approaching manhood is only under a Rabbinical obligation<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> one<br>can well justify the ruling,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> since the force of a Rabbinical marriage<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> may well annul a Rabbinical<br>vow, but if you maintain that the obligation<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> is Pentateuchal, could [it may be objected] the force of<br>a Rabbinical marriage<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> annul a Pentateuchal vow? — R. Judah citing Samuel replied: Her husband<br>may disallow her vow for her whatever your assumption might be. If the minor's obligation<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> is<br>Rabbinical, the whole matter is a Rabbinical affair; and if the obligation is Pentateuchal, it is a case<br>of a minor who eats nebelah<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> where it is not the duty of the Beth din to take it away from him. But<br>would she not be eating, in reliance upon the first disallowance,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> even when she attains her<br>majority?<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> — Rabbah b. Liwai replied: Her husband disallows her vow for her every now and<br>then.<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> This,<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> however, applies only to one who cohabited with her.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> But, surely, no husband may<br>disallow vows made prior to marriage?<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> — This<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> is in agreement with R. Phinehas who cited<br>Raba,<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> for R. Phinehas citing Raba stated: Any woman who vows acts in reliance on the opinion of<br>her husband.<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup><br>Said Abaye, Come and hear: If a minor has not yet grown two hairs, R. Judah ruled, his terumah is<br>not<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> valid; while R. Jose ruled, Before reaching the age when his vows are valid<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> his terumah is not<br>valid, but after reaching the age when his vows are valid<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> his terumah is valid.<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> Assuming<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> that R.<br>Jose is of the opinion that terumah at the present time is a Pentateuchal institution, his ruling would<br>be well justified if you grant that an intelligent minor approaching manhood is under a Pentateuchal<br>obligation,<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> since a man under a Pentateuchal obligation may well render fit<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> Pentateuchal tebel,<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup><br>but if you maintain that he is only under a Rabbinical obligation,<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> could a man under a Rabbinical<br>obligation render fit Pentateuchal tebel?<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> — No, R. Jose is of the opinion that terumah at the present<br>time is only a Rabbinical institution. But does R. Jose hold that terumah at the present time is only<br>Rabbinical? Was it not in fact taught in Seder Olam:<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> ‘Which thy fathers possessed and thou shalt<br>possess it,<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> they had a first,<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> and a second<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> possession<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> but they had no need for a third one’;<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup><br>and R. Johanan stated, ‘Who is the author of Seder Olam? R. Jose?’<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> — R. Jose may well be its<br>compiler<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> but he himself does not uphold this view.<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> This<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> may also be supported by a process of<br>reasoning. For it was taught: A dough<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> that had become subject to the restrictions of terumah<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> or<br>became sour through a leaven of terumah,<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Cf. supra n. <sup>9</sup>.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) V.

Huna's ruling evidently finds<br>support in the citation.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Issur instead of issar (‘bond’, self-imposed prohibition).<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Without incurring a flogging.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Sc. one understanding the significance of vows and dedications.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) As in the case of all Pentateuchal prohibitions.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Since the Rabbis do not subject minors to preventive measures.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Issur (cf. prev. n. but three).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Spoken of supra, which is in fact only Rabbinical.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) Not to the minor himself (cf. prev. n. but two).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) According to which those responsible for a minor must prevent him from encroaching even on that which is only<br>Rabbinically forbidden.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) Symbolic of any religious transgression.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) But if so why (cf. Yeb. <sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>a) was there a divergence of view on this question?<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Adults.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) The original reading, ‘prohibition and [the injunction] not to break’, may, therefore, be retained and yet no support<br>would be forthcoming for R.

Cohabitation at that age having the Pentateuchal force of ‘acquisition’ the marriage<br>which thus has Pentateuchal sanction may well enable the husband to disallow a vow that has Pentateuchal sanction.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) How then can he disallow here a vow that was made by a minor before her subsequent Pentateuchally valid<br>marriage?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) The ruling that the husband may disallow the minor's vow though when she comes of age her vow would assume<br>Pentateuchal validity.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) Sc. there is no need to explain, as presumably suggested, that the husband ‘disallows the vow every now and then’,<br>for even though he only disallowed it during her minority, there is no need to disallow it again when she attains her<br>majority.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) As the minor was at least Rabbinically married when her vow was made, its validity is entirely dependent on her<br>husband's pleasure. Only where a woman was not married at all at the time her vow was made is her subsequently<br>married husband precluded from disallowing it.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) In the separate edd. of the Mishnah this word is missing.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) V. foll. n.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) Sc. an intelligent minor approaching manhood whose vows are to be examined.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) Ter.

Hiyya,<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> he used to tell them, if the youth was emaciated, ‘Let him first be fattened’;<br>and if he was stout, he used to tell them, ‘Let him first be made to lose weight’;<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> for these<br>symptoms<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> appear<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> sometimes as a result of emaciation and sometimes they appear as a result of<br>stoutness.<br>Rab stated: It is the law throughout this chapter that age is calculated from one point of time to<br>another point of time;<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> but ‘Ulla stated: This is the case only where we have explicitly learnt it.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup><br>According to ‘Ulla all is well since there is a satisfactory reason why in one case it was stated<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> ‘one<br>day’ while in the other this was not stated; but according to Rab, why was not this<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> stated in all<br>cases?<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> Furthermore, it was taught: R.

Ishmael: Scripture said, When a<br>man or a woman shall commit any sin that men commit,<sup>4</sup> Scripture<sup>5</sup> compared the ‘woman’ to the<br>‘man’ in respect of all the punishments in the Torah; as a man is subject to punishments on the<br>appearance of the one mark<sup>6</sup> so is also a woman subject to punishments on the appearance of the one<br>mark. Might it not be suggested: Either the one or the other?<sup>7</sup> — Like the man: As with the man [the<br>determining factor] is the lower mark and not the upper one so also with the woman it is the lower<br>one that determines majority but not the upper one. So<sup>8</sup> it was also taught: R. Eliezer son of R.<br>Zadok stated, Thus did they explain and promulgate at Jamnia: As soon as the lower mark makes its<br>appearance no attention need any longer be paid to the upper one.<br>It was taught: R. Simeon b. Gamaliel stated, Among towns-women the lower mark appears earlier<br>because they are in the habit of taking baths; among village women the upper mark appears earlier<br>because they grind with millstones.<sup>9</sup> R. Simeon b. Eleazar stated: Among the daughters of the rich<br>the right hand side develops earlier because it rubs against their scarves;<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> among the daughters of<br>the poor the left side develops earlier because they carry<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> jars of water on them. And if you prefer I<br>might say, Because they carry their brothers on their sides.<br>Our Rabbis taught: The left side develops earlier than the right side. R. Hanina the son of the<br>brother of R. Joshua stated: The left side never developed earlier than the right side except in the<br>case of one woman who lived in our neighbourhood whose left side developed earlier than the right<br>one which later regained its normal strength.<br>Our Rabbis taught: All girls to be examined must be examined by women. So also R. Eliezer<br>entrusted the examination to his wife, and R. Ishmael entrusted it to his mother. R. Judah ruled:<br>Before the period<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> and after the period,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> women examine them.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> During the period<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> no woman<br>may examine them, since in doubtful cases<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> no woman is allowed to marry<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> on the evidence of<br>women. R. Simeon ruled, Even during the period<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> women examine them. And a woman may be<br>relied upon when by her evidence the law is restricted but not when it is relaxed thereby. How so?<br>[She may be relied upon when she states: ‘The girl] is of age’, so that the latter should thereby be<br>denied the right of mi'un, or ‘She is a minor’, so that she should thereby be denied the right of<br>performing halizah; but she is not trusted when asserting, ‘She is a minor’, so that she should have<br>the right of exercising mi'un, or ‘She is of age’, so that she should be entitled to perform halizah.<br>The Master said, ‘R. Judah ruled: Before the period and after the period women examine them’.<br>One can well concede that before the period an examination is required, for should [the same hairs]<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup><br>be found after the period they would be regarded as a mole;<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> but what need could there be for an<br>examination after the period seeing that Raba has laid down that a minor who has attained the age of<br>her majority need not be examined since there is presumption that she had by that time produced the<br>marks of puberty? — When Raba stated, ‘there is presumption’, he meant it in respect of mi'un,<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> but<br>as regards halizah<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> an examination is still required.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> ‘During the period no women may examine<br>them’, because he is of the opinion [that the presence of hairs] during the period [is a mark of<br>majority] as after the period;<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> but after the period, when Raba's presumption is applicable, we rely<br>upon women who may, therefore, conduct the examination,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> while during the period, when Raba's<br>presumption is not applicable, we cannot rely upon women, and women, therefore, may not conduct<br>the examination. ‘R. Simeon ruled, Even during the period women examine them’, for he is of the<br>opinion [that the presence of hairs] during the period [is no more a mark of puberty] than it is before<br>the period; and an examination is, therefore, required so that if [the same hairs]<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> should be found<br>after the period they would be regarded as a mole.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> ‘And a woman may be relied upon when by her<br>evidence the law is restricted but not when it is relaxed thereby.’ Who taught this? — If you wish I<br>might say: R.

        "R. Judah<sup>1</sup> said: One inverts the handles of the pot into the tub<sup>2</sup> and allows water to float over it. If it<br>then absorbs any, it may be taken for granted that it will let liquids in; but if not, it may be taken for<br>granted that it only lets liquids out. Or else, it<sup>3</sup> may be put upon a fire. If the fire stops the leakage it<br>is certain that the pot will only let liquids out; but if not it is certain that it also lets liquids in. R. Jose<br>said: One does not put it upon the actual<sup>4</sup> fire since the fire stops it,<sup>5</sup> but it is put upon embers. If the<br>embers stop it, it is certain that it only lets liquids out, but if not, it is certain that it also lets liquids<br>in. If it drips drop after drop<sup>6</sup> it is certain that it lets liquids in. What is the practical difference<br>between the first Tanna<sup>7</sup> and R. Judah? — ‘Ulla replied: The practical difference between them is a<br>case of absorption under pressure.<sup>8</sup><br>ANY LIMB THAT GROWS A NAIL etc. If it grows a nail<sup>9</sup> it<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> conveys uncleanness<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> by means<br>of touch, carriage and overshadowing.

And both statements were necessary. For if we had been informed of<br>the proselyte only it might have been presumed that it applied to him alone because he is eligible to<br>enter the Assembly<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> but not to a bastard who is not eligible to enter the Assembly.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> And if we had<br>been informed of the bastard only it might have been presumed to apply to him alone because he<br>issues from an eligible source<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> but not to a proselyte who issues from an ineligible source.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> Hence<br>the necessity for both rulings.<br><b>MISHNAH</b>.

        "— R. Meir.<sup>1</sup> For it was taught: R. Meir used to say, What was the purport of the Scriptural text,<br>According to their word shall every controversy and every leprosy be?<sup>2</sup> What connection could<br>controversies have with leprosies? But<sup>3</sup> controversies were compared to leprosies, as leprosies must<br>be examined by day, since it is written, And in the day when . . . appeareth in him,<sup>4</sup> so must<br>controversies be tried by day; and<sup>5</sup> as leprosies are not to be examined by a blind man,<sup>6</sup> since it is<br>written, Wherever the priest looketh,<sup>7</sup> so are controversies not to be tried by a blind man.<sup>6</sup> And<sup>8</sup><br>leprosies are further compared to controversies: As controversies are not to be tried by relatives, so<br>are leprosies not to be examined by relatives. In case [one were to argue:] ‘As controversies must be<br>tried by three men so must leprosies also be examined by three men, this being logically arrived at a<br>minori ad majus: If controversies affecting one's wealth must be tried by three men, how much more<br>so matters affecting one's body’, it was explicitly stated, When he shall be brought unto Aaron the<br>priest or unto one of his sons the priests.<sup>9</sup> Thus you have learnt that even a single<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> priest may<br>examine leprosies.<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup><br>A certain blind man who lived in the neighbourhood of R. Johanan used to try lawsuits and the<br>latter<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> told him nothing against it. But how could he<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> act in this manner, seeing that R. Johanan<br>actually stated, ‘The halachah is in agreement with an anonymous Mishnah’, and we have learnt,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup><br>WHOSOEVER IS ELIGIBLE TO ACT AS JUDGE IS ELIGIBLE TO ACT AS WITNESS, BUT<br>ONE MAY BE ELIGIBLE TO ACT AS WITNESS AND NOT AS JUDGE,and when the question<br>was raised, ‘What was this intended to include?’ R. Johanan replied, ‘To include one who is blind in<br>one eye’?<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> — R. Johanan found another anonymous Mishnah.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> For we have learnt, Monetary suits<br>must be tried by day and may be concluded by night.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> But why should this anonymous Mishnah<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup><br>be deemed more authoritative than the former?<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> If you wish I might reply: An anonymous Mishnah<br>which represents the view of a majority<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> is preferable. And if you prefer I might reply: Because it<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup><br>was taught among the laws of legal procedure.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup><br><b>MISHNAH</b>.

What was this<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> intended to include? — To include the fig-tree and vegetables, which<br>are not subject to the obligation of pe'ah.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> For we have learnt: They<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> have laid down a general rule<br>concerning pe'ah. Whatsoever is a foodstuff, is kept under watch, grows<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> from the ground, is all<br>harvested at the same time, and is taken in for storage, is subject to pe'ah.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> ‘A foodstuff’, excludes<br>the after-growths of woad and madder;<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> ‘is kept under watch’, excludes hefker; ‘grows<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> from the<br>ground’, excludes morils and truffles;<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> ‘is all harvested at the same time’, excludes the fig-tree;<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup><br>and is taken in for storage’, excludes vegetables. As regards tithes, however, we have learnt:<br>Whatsoever is a foodstuff, is kept under watch and grows from the ground is subject to the obligation<br>of tithes;<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> whereas ‘is all harvested at the same time<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> and is taken in for storage’<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> was not<br>mentioned.<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> But if garlic or onions<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> grew among them<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> they are subject [to pe'ah].

Johanan.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) As an anonymous Mishnah.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Which clearly shows that according to R. Johanan no blind man is eligible to act as judge.

        "it is necessary<sup>1</sup> that he should intend them for the purpose<sup>2</sup> after they had been detached; he being of<br>the opinion that intention<sup>2</sup> concerning attached [produce] is no valid intention.

Zera said:<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> We are dealing here<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> with a<br>[flying] pigeon that dropped from on high, so that it was not before us<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> to enable one to have any<br>intentions about it.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> Said Abaye to him:<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> What can be said about the [case of the] hen of Jamnia?<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup><br>— That, the other<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> replied, was a wild cock.<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> They laughed at him: A wild cock is an unclean bird<br>and an unclean bird does not convey uncleanness!<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> — ‘When a great man’, Abaye told them, ‘said<br>something, do not laugh at him. This was a case of a hen that ran away;<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> and as to the meaning<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> of<br>\"wild\", it turned wild as far as its master was concerned’.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> R. Papa said: It was a field-hen.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> R.<br>Papa thus followed his known view. For R. Papa ruled, A field-cock is forbidden and a field-hen is<br>permitted; and your mnemonic is ‘A male Ammonite<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> but not a female Ammonite’. Amemar laid<br>down in his discourse that a field-hen is forbidden.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> The Rabbis observed that it stamps on its prey<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup><br>when eating it;<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> and it is this bird that is known as girutha.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: If a pigeon<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> fell into a winepress<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> and it was intended to pick it up for a<br>Samaritan,<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> it is unclean;<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> but if it was intended for a dog it is clean,<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> R. Johanan b. Nuri<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> ruled,<br>Even if intended for a dog it is unclean.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> R. Johanan b. Nuri argued: This is arrived at a minori ad<br>majus. If it<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> conveys a major uncleanness,<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> though there was no intention,<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> should it not convey a<br>minor uncleanness<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> though there was no intention? They answered him: No; if you maintain your<br>view in the case of a major uncleanness, which never descends to that,<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> would you also maintain it<br>in the case of a minor uncleanness which does descend to that?<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> He replied: the hen of Jamnia<br>proves my contention, for it descends to that and, though there was no intention, it was declared<br>unclean. ‘From there’, they retorted, ‘is your proof? In that place there were Samaritans and it was<br>intended that they shall eat it.’ Now with what case are we dealing here? If it be suggested with big<br>cities [the objection would arise]: What need was there for intention, seeing that we have learnt: The<br>carcass of a clean beast anywhere<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> and the carcass of a clean bird and forbidden fat in large towns<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup><br>require neither intention nor to be rendered susceptible.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> If, however, it is suggested: Of villages,<br>[the difficulty arises:] Is there any authority who maintains that in this case no intention is required,<br>seeing that we have learnt: The carcass of an unclean beast<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> anywhere<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> and the carcass of a clean<br>bird in villages<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> require<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> intention<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> but need not be rendered susceptible?<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> — R. Ze'ira b. Hanina<br>replied: We are in fact dealing with an incident in a big city, but<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> the winepress caused it<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> to be<br>objectionable<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> and thus caused the town to be regarded as a village.<br>‘R. Johanan b. Nuri argued: This is arrived at a minori ad majus. If it conveys a major<br>uncleanness, though there was no intention, should it not convey a minor uncleanness though there<br>was no intention? They answered him: No; if you maintain your view in the case of a major<br>uncleanness which never descends to that.’ What is meant by ‘it never descends to that’? — Raba<br>replied: It is this that they<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> in effect said to him,<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> ‘No; if you maintain your view<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) If they are to be rendered susceptible to food-uncleanness as human food.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) To be used as human food.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) The bracketed words are not in the cited Mishnah.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Cf. prev. n. but one mut. mut.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) By intentionally wetting it.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) As is the case with other dry foodstuffs which must come in contact with liquids before they can be capable of<br>contracting uncleanness.

        "in the case of a major uncleanness which never causes an uncleanness of the same grade,<sup>1</sup> would you<br>also maintain it in the case of a minor uncleanness which does cause an uncleanness of the same<br>grade?’<sup>2</sup> Said Abaye to him: [Should not this<sup>3</sup> apply to the latter] with even more reason: If a major<br>uncleanness, concerning which the law has been relaxed in that it does not cause an uncleanness of<br>the same grade,<sup>4</sup> conveys uncleanness in the absence of intention, how much more then should a<br>minor uncleanness, concerning which the law has been restricted in that it does cause uncleanness of<br>the same grade,<sup>5</sup> convey uncleanness even where there was no intention? — Rather, said R.<br>Shesheth, It is this that they<sup>6</sup> implied: ‘No; if you maintain your view<sup>7</sup> in the case of a major<br>uncleanness, which need not be rendered susceptible,<sup>8</sup> would you also maintain it<sup>7</sup> in the case of a<br>minor uncleanness which does require to be rendered susceptible?’ But is it required to be rendered<br>susceptible? Have we not in fact learnt:<sup>9</sup> Three<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> things have been said about the carrion of a clean<br>bird,<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> it is necessary that it should be intended for food, it conveys uncleanness through the<br>oesophagus only,<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> and there is no need for it to be rendered susceptible?<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> — Granted that it is not<br>required that a dead creeping thing shall render it susceptible,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> it is nevertheless necessary that it<br>shall be rendered susceptible<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> by means of water.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> Why<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> is it not required that a dead creeping<br>thing shall render it susceptible? In agreement with what the school of R. Ishmael taught. But then<br>there should be no need for it to be rendered susceptible by means of water also in agreement with<br>what the school of R. Ishmael taught; for the school of R. Ishmael taught: Upon any sowing seed<br>which is to be sown,<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> as seeds<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> which do not eventually contract a major uncleanness<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> must<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> be<br>rendered susceptible so must any other thing which does not eventually contract a major uncleanness<br>be rendered susceptible; the carcass of a clean bird is excluded, in that it need not be rendered<br>susceptible, since it eventually contracts a major uncleanness?<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> — Rather, replied Raba, or as some<br>say R. Papa, [the reference<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> is to] a major uncleanness in general and to a minor uncleanness in<br>general.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup><br>Raba stated: R. Johanan,<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> however, agrees in regard to tithe that intention<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> concerning attached<br>[produce] is a valid intention.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> Raba explained, Whence do I derive this? From what we learnt:<br>Savory,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> hyssop and calamint<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> that are grown in a courtyard, if they are kept under watch,<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> are<br>subject to tithe.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> Now how are we to imagine the circumstances?<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> If it be suggested that these<br>herbs were originally sown for human consumption [the difficulty would arise]: Was it at all<br>necessary to enunciate such a law?<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> Consequently the circumstances must be such, must they not,<br>that the herbs were originally sown for cattle food; and yet it was stated, ‘if they are kept under<br>watch’<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> they ‘are subject to tithe’.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> R. Ashi retorted: Here<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> we are dealing with a courtyard in<br>which the herbs grew spontaneously<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> so that as a rule they are destined for human consumption,<br>and<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> it is this that was meant: If the courtyard affords protection for the produce it grows<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> the herbs<br>are subject to tithe; otherwise they are exempt.<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup><br>R. Ashi objected:<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> Whatsoever is subject to tithes is susceptible to food uncleanness.<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> Now if<br>that were so,<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> would there not be the case of these<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> which are liable to tithe<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> and yet<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> do not<br>become susceptible to the uncleanness of food?<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> — The fact is, said Raba, that it is this that was<br>meant: Any species that is liable to tithe is susceptible to food uncleanness. This<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> is also logically<br>sound. For in the final clause<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> it was stated, Whatsoever is subject to the law of the first of the<br>fleece<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> is also subject to that of the priestly gifts<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> but there may be a beast<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> that is subject to the<br>law of the priestly gifts and is not subject to that of the first of the fleece.<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> Now if it were so<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> [the<br>objection would arise]: Is there not also the case of the terefah which is subject to the law of the first<br>of the fleece and yet is not subject to that of the priestly gifts?<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> — Rabina retorted: This<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> represents<br>the view of<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> R. Simeon. For it was taught:<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> R. Simeon exempts the terefah from the law of the first<br>of the fleece.<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> R. Shimi b. Ashi replied,<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> Come and hear: If a man declared his vineyard hefker<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup><br>and, rising early in the morning, he cut its grapes, he is liable<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> to peret,<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> ‘oleloth,<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> the forgotten<br>sheaf<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> and pe'ah<sup>6</sup><sup>4</sup> but<sup>6</sup><sup>5</sup> is exempt from tithe.<sup>6</sup><sup>6</sup> But have we not learnt: WHATSOEVER IS<br>SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION OF PE'AH IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THAT OF TITHES?<sup>6</sup><sup>7</sup><br>Must you not then infer from this<sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup> that the reference<sup>6</sup><sup>9</sup> was<sup>7</sup><sup>0</sup> to the whole species?<sup>7</sup><sup>1</sup> This is<br>conclusive.<br>Elsewhere we have learnt:<sup>7</sup><sup>2</sup> The Sages agree with R.

        "Now dill, surely, since it is liable to pe'ah is also liable<sup>1</sup> to tithe, for we have learnt, WHATSOEVER<br>IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION OF PE'AH IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THAT OF TITHES; and<br>since it is liable to tithe it is also susceptible to food uncleanness. It is accordingly evident that<br>anything that is used as a flavouring is susceptible to food uncleanness, since dill is used as a<br>flavouring. But is not this incongruous with the following: ‘Castus,<sup>2</sup> amomum,<sup>3</sup> and the principal<br>spices, crowfoot, asafoetida, pepper and lozenges of bastard safron may be bought with second tithe<br>money but they are not susceptible to food uncleanness; so R.

But since we have learnt, SHE IS UNDER AN OBLIGATION TO PERFORM ALL<br>THE COMMANDMENTS THAT ARE ENUMERATED IN THE TORAH, what need was there for<br>stating, SHE MAY EITHER PERFORM HALIZAH OR CONTRACT LEVIRATE MARRIAGE?<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup><br>— To exclude a ruling of R. Jose who stated, ‘In the Biblical section<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> it is written man,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> but as<br>regards a woman there is no difference between a major and a minor’.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> Hence we were informed<br>that<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> if she has grown two hairs she may perform halizah,<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> but otherwise she may not. What is the<br>reason? A woman is to be compared to man.<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup><br>But since it was stated, SO ALSO A BOY, IF HE HAS GROWN TWO PUBIC HAIRS,<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> what<br>need was there for stating, HE IS UNDER AN OBLIGATION TO PERFORM ALL THE<br>COMMANDMENTS ENUMERATED IN THE TORAH? And should you reply: Because it was<br>desired to teach, HE IS FURTHERMORE LIABLE TO THE PENALTY OF A STUBBORN AND<br>REBELLIOUS SON [the objection would arise]: Have we not learnt this once: ‘When does one<br>become liable to the penalty of a stubborn and rebellious son? As soon as one grows two hairs until<br>the time the beard forms a circle. (By this was meant the lower, and not the upper one, but the Sages<br>used a euphemism)’? — This is so indeed; only because details were specified about the girl those<br>relating to the boy were also specified.<br>IF A GIRL HAS GROWN etc. R. Abbahu citing R. Eleazar stated, The halachah is in agreement<br>with R. JUDAH. R. Judah, however, agrees that if she was subjected to cohabitation after she had<br>grown two hairs,<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> she may no longer exercise the right of mi'un.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> The colleagues of R. Kahana<br>desired to give a practical decision<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> in agreement with the ruling of R. Judah, although intercourse<br>had taken place, but R. Kahana addressed them as follows: Did not such an incident happen with the<br>daughter of R. Ishmael?<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> She, namely, came to the schoolhouse to exercise the right of mi'un while<br>her son was riding on her shoulder; and on that day were the views of R. Ishmael mentioned at the<br>schoolhouse; and the Rabbis wept bitterly<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> saying, ‘Over a ruling which that righteous man<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> had<br>laid down should his offspring stumble!’ For Rab Judah citing Samuel who had it from R. Ishmael<br>stated: And she be not seized,<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> [then only]<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> is she forbidden,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> but if she was seized she is<br>permitted. There is, however, another class of woman who is permitted<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> even if she was not seized.<br>And who is that? A woman whose betrothal was a mistaken one,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> and who, even if her son sits<br>riding on her shoulder, may exercise the right of mi'un and go away.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> Thereupon they took a vote<br>and decided: Up to what age may a girl<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> exercise the right of mi'un? Until that at which she grows<br>two hairs. [On hearing this incident] they<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> abstained and did not act as they first intended.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup><br>R. Isaac and the disciples of R. Hanina gave a practical decision in agreement with R. Judah,<br>though the girl had been subjected to intercourse. R. Shamin b. Abba proceeded to tell it in the<br>presence of R. Johanan; R. Johanan proceeded to tell it in the presence of R. Judah Nesi'ah<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> and the<br>latter sent a constable<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> who took her away.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup><br>R. Hisda citing Mar Ukba stated: The meaning<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> is not that the black must actually predominate<br>but that it shall be such as, when two hairs lie flat, has the appearance<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> of the black predominating<br>over the white,<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> Raba stated: Two hairs that reach from rim to rim.<br>R. Helbo citing R. Huna stated: The two hairs of which the Rabbis spoke<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> must<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> have follicles at<br>their roots. R. Malkio citing R. Adda b. Ahabah ruled: Follicles suffice even in the absence of hairs.<br>Said R. Hanina the son of R. Ika: The rulings concerning a spit,<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> bondwomen<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> and follicles<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> were<br>laid down by R. Malkio, but those concerning a forelock,<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> wood-ash<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> and cheese<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> were laid down<br>by R. Malkia. R. Papa, however, stated: If the statement was made on a Mishnah or a Baraitha the<br>author is R. Malkia but if on reported traditions<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> the author is R. Malkio. And the mnemonic<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> is,<br>‘The mathnitha<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> is queen’.<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> What is the practical difference between them?<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> — The practical<br>difference between them is the statement on bondwomen.<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> R. Ashi stated, Mar Zutra told me that R.<br>Hanina of Sura felt about this the following difficulty: Would not a single Tanna<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> go out of his way<br>to teach<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> us the law of the follicles? — If one<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> had informed us of the law of the follicles it might<br>have been presumed that [puberty is not established] unless there were two hairs in two follicles<br>respectively, hence we were informed<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> that even two hairs in one follicle are sufficient. But is there<br>such a phenomenon?<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> Is it not in fact written in Scripture, He that would break me with a tempest,<br>and multiply my wounds without cause<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> in connection with which Raba<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> remarked: Job<br>blasphemed with the mention of tempest and he was answered with a tempest. He ‘blasphemed with<br>the mention of tempest’, saying to Him, ‘Sovereign of the world, perhaps a tempest has passed<br>before Thee, and caused Thee to confuse \"Job\"<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> with \"enemy\"?’<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> ‘He was answered with a<br>tempest’: Then the Lord answered<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Before the smelling of which, but not after, a benediction (cf.

        "Job out of the whirlwind, and said<sup>1</sup> to him, ‘Most foolish man,<sup>2</sup> I have created many hairs<sup>3</sup> in a man's<br>head and for every hair I have created a separate follicle, so that two should not suck from the same<br>follicle, for if two were to suck from the same follicle they would impair the sight of man.

A WOMAN WHO OBSERVED A BLOOD-STAIN<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> IS IN AN UNSETTLED<br>CONDITION<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> AND MUST<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT<br>WAS DUE TO ZIBAH; SO R. MEIR. BUT THE SAGES RULED: IN THE CASE OF<br>BLOOD-STAINS THERE IS NO [NEED TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR BEING]<br>DUE TO ZIBAH.<br><b>GEMARA</b>. Who are THE SAGES? — R. Hanina b. Antigonus. For it was taught: R. Hanina b.<br>Antigonus ruled, In the case of blood-stains there is no [need to consider the possibility of their<br>being] due to zibah, but sometimes blood-stains do lead to zibah. How so? If a woman<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> put on three<br>shirts that she had previously examined and then found a blood-stain on each of them, or if she<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup><br>observed a discharge<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> on two days and [a blood-stain on] one shirt,<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> these are the blood-stains that<br>lead to zibah. But since in the case of three shirts, where she observed no direct discharge from her<br>body, the possibility of zibah is taken into consideration, why was it necessary to mention<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> that of<br>‘two days and one shirt’? — It might have been presumed<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> that in any instance like this<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> the<br>woman brings a sacrifice which may be eaten,<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> hence we were informed [that only the possibility<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup><br>of zibah is taken into consideration].<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> Raba observed: In this matter R. Hanina b. Antigonus<br>vindicated his case against the Rabbis. For why is it [that when a bloodstain] less than three beans in<br>size is in one spot we do not take into consideration the possibility of zibah? [presumably] because<br>we assume that it is the result of observations on two days.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> But then why should we not, even if a<br>stain of the size of three beans was in one spot, similarly assume that only to the extent of the size of<br>two and a half beans the discharge was from her body while the rest is the blood of a louse due to the<br>filth?<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> — And the Rabbis?<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> — Since the stain<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> can be divided up into parts of the size of a bean<br>and over for each day<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> we do not ascribe it to any external cause. As to R. Hanina b. Antigonus, is<br>it<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> only when a stain of the size of three beans in one spot that we do not take the possibility of<br>zibah into consideration, but if it is in three different places<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> the possibility is taken into<br>consideration? But did you not say<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> that this<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> applies only to stains on<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> three shirts,<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> from which<br>it follows that it does not apply to stains<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> in three spots?<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> — He<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> spoke to them on the line of the<br>view of the Rabbis. As far as I am concerned, he said in effect, it<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> applies only to three shirts<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> and<br>not to three spots;<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> but according to your view, agree with me at least that, where she had observed<br>a stain of the size of three beans in one spot, we assume that to the extent of two and a half beans the<br>discharge came from her body while the rest is the blood of a louse due to the filth. And the Rabbis?<br>— Since the stain<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> can be divided up into parts of the size of a little more than a bean for each<br>day,<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> we do not ascribe it to any external cause,<br>Our Rabbis taught: If a woman observed a blood-stain, if it is big enough<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> to be divided into parts<br>corresponding respectively to three beans, each of which being slightly bigger than the size of a<br>bean, she must take into consideration the possibility of zibah; otherwise, she need not take this<br>possibility into consideration.

        "Rabbi stated: R. Judah b. Agra's ruling is acceptable where she did not examine<sup>1</sup> and the ruling of the<br>Sages where she did examine. What is meant by ‘she did examine’ and by ‘she did not examine’? —<br>Raba replied: I found the Rabbis of the schoolhouse sitting at their studies and discoursing thus:<br>‘Here<sup>2</sup> we are dealing with the case of a woman who examined herself,<sup>3</sup> but did not examine her<br>shirt;<sup>4</sup> and even her own body was examined by her only at the twilight of R. Judah,<sup>5</sup> while at the<br>twilight of R. Jose<sup>6</sup> she did not examine herself. In such a case, the Rabbis being of the opinion that<br>at the twilight of R. Jose it is already night, [the question of zibah does not arise] since she had<br>examined herself at the twilight of R. Judah,<sup>7</sup> and R. Jose follows his own view, he having stated that<br>twilight is a doubtful time’.<sup>8</sup> But I said to him: ‘Had her hands been kept in her eyes<sup>9</sup> throughout the<br>twilight<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> you would<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> have spoken well,<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> but now,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> is it not possible that she experienced a<br>discharge<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> as soon as she had removed her hands?’<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> They then told me, ‘We only spoke of a case<br>where the woman had her hands in her eyes<sup>9</sup> throughout the twilight’.<br>‘Rabbi stated: R. Judah b. Agra's ruling<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> is acceptable where she did not examine’. Now<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> what is<br>meant by ‘she did not examine’? If it be suggested that she examined herself in the twilight of R.<br>Judah but did not examine herself in the twilight of R. Jose [the difficulty would arise]: From this<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> it<br>follows that R. Judah holds<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> that even where she examined herself both times,<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> the possibility of<br>zibah must be considered; [but why should this be so] seeing that she did examine herself?<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> It is<br>obvious then [that the meaning<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> is] that she did not examine herself either in the twilight of R.<br>Judah or in that of R. Jose;<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> but if she had examined herself in R. Judah's twilight<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> and did not<br>examine herself in R. Jose's<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> there is no need for her to consider the possibility [of zibah].<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> It is<br>thus clear that the twilight of R. Jose is according to Rabbi<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> regarded as night.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> Now read the final<br>clause: ‘And the ruling of the Sages where she did examine’ — What is meant by ‘she did examine’?<br>If it be suggested that she examined herself in the twilight of R. Judah but did not examine herself in<br>that of R. Jose,<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> it would follow<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> that the Rabbis are of the opinion that even if she did not examine<br>herself in either<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> there is no need to consider the possibility of zibah [but why should this be so]<br>seeing that she did not examine herself?<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> It is obvious then that [the meaning<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> is] that she<br>examined herself both in the twilight of R. Judah and in that of R. Jose, but that if she had examined<br>herself in the twilight of R. Judah and not in that of R. Jose the possibility of zibah<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> must be<br>considered.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> It is thus clear that the twilight of R. Jose is according to Rabbi<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> regarded as doubtful<br>time.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> Does not this then present a contradiction between two statements of Rabbi?<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> — It is this<br>that he<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> meant: The view of R. Judah b. Agra<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> is acceptable to the Rabbis<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> when she did not<br>examine herself at all either in R. Judah's twilight or in that of R. Jose's, for even the Sages differed<br>from him<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> only when she has examined herself in R. Judah's twilight<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> and did not examine herself<br>in that of R. Jose,<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> but where she did not examine herself at all they agree with him,<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> But does not<br>the following show incongruity?<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> [For it was taught:] If a woman observed a bloodstain, the<br>observation being one of a large one,<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> she must take into consideration the possibility of a discharge<br>at twilight,<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> but if the observation was one of a small stain<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> she should not take the possibility into<br>consideration. This is the ruling of R. Judah b. Agra who cited it in the name of R. Jose. Said Rabbi:<br>I heard from him<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> that in both cases must the possibility be taken into consideration; ‘and’, he said<br>to me, ‘it is for this reason: What if she had been a menstruant who did not<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> make sure of her<br>cleanness<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> from the minha time<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> and onwards, would she not<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> have been regarded as being in a<br>presumptive state of uncleanness?<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> And his ruling is acceptable to me where she has examined<br>herself. Now what is meant by ‘she has examined herself’? If it be suggested that she has examined<br>herself in the twilight of R. Judah and did not examine herself in that of R. Jose, it would follow that<br>R. Judah b. Agra holds that even though she did not examine herself either in the twilight of R.<br>Judah or in that of R. Jose the possibility need not be considered; but why should this be so seeing<br>that she did not examine herself? It must be obvious then that she did examine herself both in the<br>twilight of R. Judah and in that of R. Jose. Thus it follows that R. Judah b. Agra holds that if she<br>examined herself in the twilight of R. Judah and not in that of R. Jose she need not consider the<br>possibility. It is thus clear that the twilight of R. Jose is according to R. Judah b. Agra regarded as<br>night. Does not this then present a contradiction between two rulings of R. Judah b. Agra?<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> In the<br>absence of Rabbi's interpretations<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> there would well be no difficulty, since the former ruling might<br>refer to a case where she has examined herself in R. Judah's twilight and not in that of R. Jose while<br>here it is a case where she has examined herself in R. Jose's twilight as in that of R. Judah's; but with<br>Rabbi's interpretations<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> does not the contradiction arise? — Two Tannas expressed different views<br>as to the opinion of R. Judah b. Agra. The first Tanna holds that the twilight of R. Judah ends first<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) This is discussed presently.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) In the dispute between R. Judah b. Agra and the Rabbis,<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Each day at twilight.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Which was examined for the first time on the third day when a stain of the size of two beans was discovered. As it is<br>thus unknown when the stain was made, the possibility must be taken into consideration that there may have been a<br>discharge at the twilight of each, or at least one, of the two days; and, since a discharge at twilight counts as two (one for<br>the passing and one for the coming day), that she had experienced no less than three discharges on three consecutive<br>days.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Which extends after sunset for a time during which one can walk a distance of a thousand cubits.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Which lasts no longer than a ‘wink of the eye’, beginning and ending later than R. Judah's twilight.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) When she had ascertained that on that day she was clean, Any subsequent discharge at the twilight of R. Jose could<br>only be counted as one for the following day. The total of her discharges cannot consequently have been more than two.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Cf. prev. n. but one, As it is possible that there was a discharge at that time (which counts as both possible day and<br>possible night) the woman must be treated as if she experienced two discharges (one on the passing, and one on the<br>incoming day) in addition to the discharge on the other day in question, thus making a total of three discharges.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Euphemism.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Of R. Judah.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) As far as the Rabbis are concerned.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Since it would have been definitely established that during the passing day no discharge had occurred.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) That a general statement was made that the discharge is always ascribed to one day only.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) During the twilight of R. Judah.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) And this would count as two.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) That the possibility of zibah is to be considered even where a stain is not big enough to be divided into three parts,<br>each of the prescribed minimum.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Since Rabbi stated that only in this case he accepted the ruling of R. Judah b. Agra, it follows that where she did<br>examine herself he does not accept his ruling though R. Judah himself maintains that the possibility of zibah must be<br>considered even in the latter case.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Since ‘no examination’ only means the absence of one in R. Jose's twilight though one did take place in R. Judah's<br>twilight.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Cf. prev. n. but one.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) The twilight of R. Judah and the twilight of R. Jose.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Making sure that on that day there was no discharge. How then could one subsequent possible discharge in the night<br>be counted as two?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Of the expression ‘she did not examine’,<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) So that the possibility must be considered that she may have experienced a discharge in R. Judah's twilight.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Thus ascertaining that she was clean on that day.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) Which is regarded as night.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Since one discharge in the night cannot possibly be counted as two discharges.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) Who on this point disagrees with R. Judah.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) Cf. prev. n. but two<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) And it is in this case only that Rabbi stated that the ruling of the Sages is acceptable but, it follows, where she<br>examined herself in neither, though the Rabbis still maintain that the possibility of zibah need not be considered he holds<br>that it must be taken into consideration.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) Cf. prev. n.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Lit., ‘in the two’. The twilights of R. Judah and R. Jose respectively.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) In consequence of which she may have experienced a discharge at twilight when the one discharge is counted as<br>two. How then could the possibility of zibah be ruled out?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) Of the expression ‘she did examine’, in Rabbi's approval of the ruling of the Sages.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) According to Rabbi who in this case disagrees with the Sages’ ruling.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) It being possible that she experienced a discharge in R. Jose's twilight when one discharge is counted as two.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) Who on this point disagrees with the Sages.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) Cf. prev. n. but one.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) Lit., ‘a difficulty of Rabbi on Rabbi’. According to the inference from the first clause R. Jose's twilight is regarded<br>by him as right while according to the inference from the final clause it is doubtful whether it is day or night.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) Rabbi.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) That the possibility of a discharge at twilight is to be considered.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) Not to himself; sc. Rabbi did not express any opinion as to what view he accepted and with whom he agreed (as was<br>previously assumed when the contradiction was pointed out) but merely explained the extent and limits of the dispute<br>between the Sages and R. Judah b. Agra.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) In maintaining that the possibility (cf. p. <sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup>, n. <sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) may be disregarded.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) Thus ascertaining that there was no discharge at twilight.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) Which in their opinion is regarded as night.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) Cf. p. <sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup> n. <sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>. R. Jose, however, who holds his twilight to be a doubtful time, takes into consideration the<br>possibility of a discharge in his twilight which would be regarded as two, one of which must be attributed to the passing,<br>and the other to the incoming day.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) With what had been said supra that according to R. Judah b. Agra it is not certain whether the twilight of R. Jose is<br>night or day.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup>) One that can be divided into three stains each of which is slightly bigger than the size of a bean.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup>) Which counts as two.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup>) Sc. one not bigger than a little more than the size of two beans, so that it can only be divided into two stains of the<br>prescribed minimum.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>) R. Jose.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup>) On the seventh day after menstruation.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup>) Lit., ‘separated in cleanness’.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup>) Two and a half seasonal hours before nightfall.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup>) Though in the morning she made sure of her cleanness.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup>) Of course she would, and in consequence she would not be allowed to undergo immersion in the evening. Thus it<br>follows that in the absence of an examination, the possibility of a discharge is considered. Similarly in the case of the<br>stain under discussion, since no examination was held at twilight, the possibility of a discharge that must be counted as<br>two must be taken into consideration.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup>) According to his first ruling supra the twilight of R. Jose is only a doubtful time while according to his present<br>ruling it is definitely night.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup>) Both here and supra.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup>) Which inevitably lead to the conclusion (as stated supra) that, according to the first ruling, R, Judah b. Agra holds<br>R. Jose's twilight to be a doubtful time, while according to his second ruling, it is definitely night.",
        "and then begins the twilight of R. Jose,<sup>1</sup> while the second Tanna holds that the twilight of R. Jose is<br>absorbed in that of R. Judah.<sup>2</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: A woman who observes a bloodstain causes uncleanness to herself<sup>3</sup> and to<br>consecrated things retrospectively;<sup>4</sup> so Rabbi. R. Simeon b. Eleazar ruled: She causes uncleanness<sup>5</sup><br>to consecrated things but does not cause uncleanness to herself, since her bloodstain cannot be<br>subject to greater restrictions than her observation.<sup>6</sup> But<sup>7</sup> do we not find that her bloodstain is subject<br>to greater restrictions in regard to consecrated things? — Read rather thus: R. Simeon b. Eleazar<br>ruled, Even to consecrated things she conveys no uncleanness,<sup>8</sup> since her bloodstain should in no<br>case be subject to greater restrictions than her observation.<sup>6</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: If a woman observed first a bloodstain and then<sup>9</sup> she observed a discharge of<br>blood she may for a period of twenty-four hours ascribe her stain to her observation;<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> so Rabbi. R.<br>Simeon b. Eleazar ruled: Only during the same day.<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> Said Rabbi: His view seems more acceptable<br>than mine, since he improves<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> her position while I make it worse. ‘He improves it’! Does he not in<br>fact<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> make it worse? — Rabina replied: Reverse the statement,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> R. Nahman said: You need not<br>really reverse it, [the meaning being:] Since he improves her position in regard to the laws of zibah<br>while I make her position worse as regards the laws of zibah.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup><br>R. Zera enquired of R. Assi: Do stains<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> necessitate an interval of cleanness<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> or not? The other<br>remained silent, answering him nothing at all. Once he<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> found him<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> as he was sitting at his studies<br>and discoursing as follows: ‘She may for twenty-four hours ascribe her stain to her observation. This<br>is the ruling of Rabbi. In connection with this Resh Lakish explained that it applied only where she<br>has examined herself,<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> while R. Johanan explained: Even though she did not examine herself’.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup><br>‘Thus it follows’, he<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> said to him,<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> ‘that<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> stains necessitate an interval of cleanness’. ‘Yes’, the<br>other<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> replied. ‘But did I not ask you this question many a time and you gave me no answer at all? It<br>is likely that you recalled the tradition<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> in the rapidity of your reviewing?’<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> — ‘Yes’, the other<br>replied, ‘in the rapidity of my reviewing I recalled it’.<br><b>MISHNAH</b>.

If, therefore, she<br>were to observe some blood on the next day following she would be regarded as a confirmed zabah, while according to<br>R. Simeon who ascribes a stain to blood observed during the same day only the woman would be deemed unclean on<br>one day only and could not become a confirmed zabah unless blood was observed on the two following days also (R.<br>Han.).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) According to Rabbi who attributes a stain to an observation of blood if the latter took place within twenty-four<br>hours, and does not regard the woman's uncleanness as having begun at the time the article (on which the stain was<br>found) had been washed,<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Sc. must the woman have examined herself between the time the article had been washed and the discovery of the<br>stain? (Tosaf.).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) R. Zera.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) R. Assi.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Near the time of discovering the stain, within twenty-four hours; but if twenty-four hours have passed between the<br>examination and the discovery of the stain the woman is deemed unclean retrospectively from the time of the<br>examination (Tosaf.).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Sc. near the examination between which and the discovery of the stain an interval of twenty-four hours had been<br>allowed to pass. Despite this interval the woman's uncleanness is not retrospective since less than twenty-four hours have<br>passed between the time the article had been washed and the discovery on it of the stain. As the uncleanness in such a<br>case is not retrospective to the time of the washing of the article, it is equally not retrospective over the twenty-four<br>hours’ period (Tosaf.). Cf. Tosaf.

        "FOOLISH WOMEN? Are they not merely IN A STATE OF PERPLEXITY?<sup>1</sup> — Rather read:<br>Women who are in a state of perplexity. For<sup>2</sup> it was taught: [If a woman is alternately] unclean on<br>one day and clean on the next,<sup>3</sup> she may perform her marital duty<sup>4</sup> on the eighth day,<sup>5</sup> the night<br>following being included,<sup>6</sup> and on four nights out of every eighteen days.<sup>7</sup> If, however, she observed<br>any issue in the evening,<sup>8</sup> she performs her marital duty on the eighth day<sup>9</sup> only.<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> [If she is<br>alternately] unclean<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> for two days and clean for two days, she may perform her marital duty on the<br>eighth,<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> the twelfth,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> the sixteenth<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> and the twentieth.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> But why is she not allowed to perform her<br>marital duty on the nineteenth?<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> — R. Shesheth replied: This<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> proves that the ‘gluttony’<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> of which<br>we have learnt<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> is forbidden. R. Ashi<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> replied: Granted that the eleventh day<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> requires no<br>safeguard,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> the tenth day<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> at any rate does require a safeguard.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> If she is alternately unclean for<br>three days and clean for three days, she may perform her marital duty on two days<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> and may never<br>again perform it.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> If she is alternately unclean for four days and clean for four days she performs her<br>marital duty on one day,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> and may never again perform it.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> If she is alternately unclean for five<br>days and clean for five days, she performs her marital duty on three days<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> and may never again<br>perform it.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> If she is alternately unclean for six days and clean for six days she performs her marital<br>duty on five days<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> and may never again perform it.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> If she is alternately unclean for seven days and<br>clean for seven days, she may perform her marital duty during a quarter of her lifetime, [seven<br>days]<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> out of each twenty-eight days.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> If she is alternately unclean for eight days and clean for<br>eight days, she may perform her marital duty on fifteen days<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> out of every forty-eight days.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> But is<br>not the number<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> fourteen?<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> — R. Adda b. Isaac replied: This proves that the days of her<br>menstruation in which she observes no discharge<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> are reckoned in the counting<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> prescribed for her<br>zibah;<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> for the question was raised:<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) V. supra p. <sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup><sup>3</sup>, n. <sup>6</sup>.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) The following series of rules applies to the WISE ONES of which R. Joshua spoke.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Sc. is discharging blood every alternate day.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) If the discharge never occurs in the night.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Counting from the one on which her first discharge was observed. On the eighth day her cleanness is established<br>beyond any possible doubt since her unclean period of menstruation terminated with the seventh, and the eighth is one of<br>her alternate clean days.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Lit., ‘and its night with it’, since (cf. Prev. n. but one) she never discharges any blood in the night.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Again counting from the day of the first discharge (cf. prev. n. but one). As she never discharges on three<br>consecutive days she can never become a major zabah (who must allow seven clean days to pass before she can attain<br>cleanness). When she discharges on the ninth day (one of the alternate unclean days) she, as a minor zabah (the<br>discharge having taken place within the eleven days of the zibah period which began on the eighth), must allow one<br>clean day (the tenth) to pass and may perform her marital duty in the night following it. Observing a discharge on the<br>eleventh day (one of the alternate unclean days) she allows the twelfth day to pass and performs her duty in the night that<br>follows. Similarly she may perform her marital duty on the nights following respectively the fourteenth and the<br>sixteenth. By the time eighteen days have passed with the sunset of the eighteenth day she has, in addition to the eighth<br>day and night following it, the four nights that follow respectively the tenth, twelfth, fourteenth and sixteenth day. The<br>night following the eighteenth day is again one in which performance of marital duty is permitted, but it belongs to the<br>next cycle. On the nineteenth, the seven days of menstruation begin again and the cycle is repeated.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Of the alternate unclean days.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) After her first discharge, sc. the day and the night preceding it. On the day she is definitely clean since her discharge<br>does not appear until evening, and in the previous night she is also clean since with the day preceding it (the seventh) her<br>unclean menstruation period had come to an end.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) During the first seven days she is unclean as a menstruant and in the night following the eighth (one of the alternate<br>unclean nights) she is unclean as a minor zabah (the zibah period having commenced on the eighth) and must<br>consequently allow one day, the ninth, to pass. On the night following the ninth (another of the alternate unclean nights)<br>she is again unclean as a minor zabah and must again allow a day, the tenth, to pass, and so on until the termination of<br>eighteen days when a new cycle of the same number of days begins in which again she is allowed marital duty on the<br>eighth day and the night preceding it only.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) The discharge making its appearance (as is also the case in all the following rulings) in the evenings.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Which (with the night preceding) is the second of the two alternating clean days and (unlike the first of these two<br>days) follows the immersion on the seventh day of the unclean seven days of the menstruation period.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) The preceding night included, On the ninth and the tenth (two of the alternating unclean days) she is (since these<br>days are within her zibah period) a minor zabah and must in consequence allow the eleventh also to pass, performing<br>immersion in the evening of that day and thus attaining cleanness on the twelfth.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Including also the night preceding it.

As the day following it (the eleventh of zibah or the eighteenth in the cycle) is an unclean one,<br>the next clean day (the nineteenth in the cycle) must be allowed to pass as a safeguard.

The thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth (three of the<br>alternating three unclean days) will be unclean days within her zibah period that subject her to the restrictions of a major<br>zabah who cannot attain cleanness before seven clean days have passed, but (owing to these three alternating unclean<br>days) she will never experience a full period of seven clean days.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) The eighth, the first day after her first unclean menstruation period, which is the last of the second group of four<br>clean days.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) Cf. prev. n, but one mut. mut.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) The eighth, ninth and tenth (immediately following the first menstruation period) being the last three of the first<br>group of five clean days.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) The eighth to twelfth.

        "May the days succeeding childbirth<sup>1</sup> on which the woman observes no discharge<sup>2</sup> be reckoned in the<br>counting prescribed for her zibah?<sup>3</sup> R.

Whence are these rulings<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> deduced? — Hezekiah replied: From Scripture which says,<br>And of her that is sick with her impurity,<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> her impurity<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> is like herself, as she conveys her<br>uncleanness so does her impurity convey similar uncleanness. Thus we find the law concerning wet<br>blood,<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> whence the deduction concerning dry blood? — R. Isaac replied: Scripture said, Be,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> it<br>shall retain its original force.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> But might it not be suggested that this<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> applies only to blood that<br>was wet and then dried up; whence, however, the deduction that it applies also to blood that was<br>originally<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> dry? And, furthermore, with reference to what we have learnt, ‘If a woman aborted an<br>object that was like a rind, like earth, like a hair, like red flies, let her put it in water and if it<br>dissolves she is unclean’, whence is this<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> deduced? — ‘Be’<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> is an inclusive statement.<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> If [it be<br>argued:] As she causes couch and seat to convey uncleanness to man and to his garments<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> so should<br>her blood also cause couch and garment to convey uncleanness to man and his garments. [it can be<br>retorted:] Is then her blood capable of using a couch or a seat?<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> — But according to your<br>argument<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> [it could also be objected]: Is a leprous stone<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> capable of using a couch or a seat that a<br>text should be required to exclude it?<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> For it was taught. ‘It might have been presumed that a<br>leprous stone should cause a couch and a seat to convey uncleanness to man and to his garments, this<br>being arrived at logically, for if a zab who does not convey uncleanness by means of entry<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> causes<br>couch and seat to convey uncleanness to man and to his garments, how much more then should a<br>leprous stone, which does convey uncleanness by means of entry,<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> convey uncleanness to couch<br>and seat to convey it to man and his garments, hence it was specifically stated, He that hath the<br>issue,<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> implying only ‘he that hath the issue’ [is subject to the restriction]<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> but not a leprous stone’.<br>Now the reason<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> is that Scripture has excluded it, but if that had not been the case it would have<br>conveyed the uncleanness, would it not?<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> — A reply may indeed be forthcoming from this very<br>statement,<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> for did you not say. ‘He that hath the issue<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> [is subject to the restriction] but not a<br>leprous stone’? Well here also Scripture said, Whereon she sitteth,<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> only she but not her blood.<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Which took place in zibah that immediately ceased.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) But is nevertheless Pentateuchally unclean.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) So that at the conclusion of seven days, and the due performance of immersion, she is exempt from the restrictions<br>that are imposed upon a zabah.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) During the eleven days of her zibah period.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Since it is possible that she gave birth to a proper child and that no bleeding accompanied it, in which case it is a<br>valid birth and no zibah. It is equally possible that the birth was not that of a proper child and that it was accompanied by<br>a flow of blood, in which case it is a proper zibah and no valid birth. It is also possible that the birth was a proper one<br>and that it was accompanied by bleeding in which case it is both a valid birth and a proper zibah. It is equally possible<br>that there was neither proper birth nor bleeding so that there was neither zibah nor valid birth.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Adopting the most restrictive course in order to meet all possible circumstances,<br>(<sup>7</sup>) In case the birth was a valid one.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Since it is possible that the birth was not valid, that in consequence no sacrifice was required, and that the bird that<br>was mistakenly killed in the manner prescribed for a sacrifice was, therefore, nebelah,<br>(<sup>9</sup>) During the first fourteen days of which, since it is possible that the birth was that of a female, the woman is unclean<br>even though no discharge was observed,<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) To the restrictions of which she is subject on account of the possibility that the miscarriage was accompanied by<br>bleeding. Thus it has been shown that the days succeeding childbirth on which no discharge is observed are reckoned in<br>the counting prescribed for a zabah.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) In the case just cited by R. Kahana where uncertainties exist,<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) From that discussed supra <sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup>a where no doubtful factor is involved,<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) After the birth of whom a woman is unclean for seven days only.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) A total of fourteen days as a precaution against the possibility that the birth was that of a female child.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) Had it, however, been certain that the birth was that of a female child (similar to the certainty supra <sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup>a) the days<br>succeeding birth could not be reckoned in the counting prescribed for a zabah.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Of course there is. The birth of the latter is as possible as the birth of the former and the possibility, therefore, exists<br>that the woman is unclean for fourteen days.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Lit., ‘but not’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) The days succeeding a childbirth during which no discharge is observed.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) In the seven days prescribed for a zabah.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) In the first group of nine days she is a menstruant during the first seven days and a minor zabah on the last two<br>days; and in the second group of nine days she allows the first day to pass (as prescribed for a minor zabah) while in the<br>remaining eight days, being fully clean, she is permitted marital intercourse. The same process is repeated in every cycle<br>of eighteen day.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) During the first ten days she is a menstruant for seven days and a zabah during the last three days, while during the<br>second group of ten days she counts the prescribed seven days and has three days left in which she is clean and permitted<br>marital intercourse. The three latter days are thus equal in number to the three days of her zibah.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) That the number of days in which marital intercourse is permitted is equal to the number of the days of zibah.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) The woman is menstrual during the first seven days of the first hundred and is a zabah during the remaining<br>ninety-three days, while the first seven days of the second hundred are counted as the days prescribed after the zibah and<br>in the remaining ninety-three days she is permitted marital intercourse.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Cf. prev. n. mut. mut.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) Sc. the maximum time.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) To cause them to be regarded as CAPABLE OF REVERTING TO THEIR ORIGINAL CONDITION.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) But if they do not resume their original freshness unless soaked for a longer time or in warmer water they convey<br>uncleanness when wet only.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) V.

Adda b.<br>Ahabah replied: It<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> must be exactly like a bone; as a bone was created simultaneously with it<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> so<br>must every other part<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> be such as was created with it.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> But are there not the hair and nails that were<br>created with it<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> and they are nevertheless clean? — Rather, said R. Adda b. Ahabah, It<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> must be<br>exactly like a bone; as a bone was created simultaneously with it<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> and when cut<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> does not grow<br>again<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> so must every other part<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> be such as was created with it and when cut<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> does not grow<br>again. The teeth are, therefore, excluded since they were not created with it,<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> and the hair and nails<br>were excluded since, though they were created with it, they<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> grow again. But skin surely [is a part<br>of the body] that<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> grows again, for<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> we have learnt: A skinned animal,<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> R. Meir declares, is<br>ritually fit,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> and only the Sages declare it to be unfit.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> And even the Rabbis declare it to be unfit<br>only because in the meantime<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> the air affects it and it would die, but the skin<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> would, as a matter of<br>fact, grow again;<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> and yet have we not learnt: In the case of the following their skins are on a par<br>with their flesh,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> viz., the skin of a human being?<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> — Surely in connection with this ruling it was<br>stated: ‘Ulla said, ‘Pentateuchally the skin of a human being is clean, and what is the reason why<br>they ruled it to be unclean? It is a preventive measure against the possibility that a person might use<br>the skins of his father and mother as spreads for an ass.’<br>Others there are who read: Skin, surely, [is a part of the body] that<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> does not grow again, for<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> we<br>have learnt: And the Sages declare it to be unfit.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> And even R. Meir declares it to be fit only<br>because its flesh hardens and the animal recovers its health but it does not, as a matter of fact, grow<br>again,<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> and yet did not ‘Ulla state, ‘Pentateuchally the skin of a man is clean’? — When ‘Ulla's<br>statement was made it had reference to the final clause<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> only: But all these,<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> if they were dressed or<br>trodden upon sufficiently to render them fit for dressing, are clean<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> with the exception of a human<br>skin.<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> And it was in connection with this ruling that ‘Ulla stated, ‘Pentateuchally the human skin is<br>clean if it had been dressed; and what is the reason why they ruled it to be unclean?

Whence is this<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> deduced? — It was taught: His issue is unclean,<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> teaches<br>concerning an issue of a zab that it is unclean.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> But cannot this be arrived at by a process of<br>reasoning: If it<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> causes uncleanness to others<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> would it not, with more reason, cause uncleanness to<br>itself?<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> The case of the scapegoat proves the contrary, since it causes uncleanness to others<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> while<br>it is itself clean. You also should not, therefore, be surprised in this case<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> where, though the issue<br>carries uncleanness to others,<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> it is itself<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> clean. Hence it was specifically stated, ‘His issue is<br>unclean’<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> teaching thereby that the issue is unclean. But might it not be suggested that this<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> applies<br>only to contact [uncleanness] but not to carriage, this being a case similar to that of a dead creeping<br>thing?<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> — R.

        "so that if a Scriptural text was required it was only in respect of carriage. But might it not be<br>suggested that by means of carriage it conveys uncleanness to both man and his garments, while by<br>means of contact it conveys uncleanness to man but not to his garments, this being a case similar to<br>that of contact with a carcass?<sup>1</sup> — This cannot be entertained, for it was taught: Others<sup>2</sup> Say, Of<br>them that have an issue, whether it be a man, or a woman,<sup>3</sup> his ‘issue’ is compared<sup>4</sup> to himself;<sup>5</sup> as in<br>his case you make no distinction between his contact and his carriage as regards the conveyance of<br>uncleanness to man and to his garments,<sup>6</sup> so also in that of his issue. But now that the law<sup>7</sup> is<br>deduced from ‘Of them that have an issue’,<sup>3</sup> what need is there for ‘His issue is unclean’?<sup>8</sup> — R.<br>Judah of Daskarta<sup>9</sup> replied: It was required; since<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> it might have been presumed that the case of the<br>scapegoat proves the contrary,<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> for it causes uncleanness to others<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> while it itself is clean; and as to<br>the deduction from<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> ‘Of them that have an issue’ [it might have been explained that] it serves the<br>purpose of indicating the number,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> viz., ‘issue’, one; ‘his issue’,<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> two; while after the third issue<br>the All Merciful compared him to the ‘woman’,<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> hence the All Merciful has written, ‘His issue is<br>unclean’. And now that the All Merciful has also written, ‘His issue is unclean’<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> you may apply to<br>the other text<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> this exposition<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> also.<br>AND SPITTLE. Whence do we deduce [the uncleanness of] spittle? — It was taught And if he<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> .<br>. . spit.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> As this might be presumed to apply even if the spittle did not touch,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> it was explicitly<br>stated, upon him that is clean,<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> only if it touched him that is clean.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> Thus I know the law<br>concerning his spittle only,<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> whence could I deduce the uncleanness of his mucus, phlegm and nasal<br>discharge? From the explicit statement, And<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> if he . . . spit.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup><br>The Master said, ‘As this might be presumed to apply even if the spittle did not touch’,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> but<br>whence could this uncleanness<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> be deduced? — It might have been presumed that the expression of<br>‘spit’ here<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> may be inferred from that of ‘spit’<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> mentioned in the case of a yebamah, as there the<br>act<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> is valid though the spittle does not touch [the yabam] so is the act<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> valid here also even though<br>the spittle did not touch the clean person, hence we were informed [that actual contact is essential].<br>But might it not be suggested that this<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> applies only to touch<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> but not to carriage, the law being<br>similar to that of a dead creeping thing?<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> — Resh Lakish replied: The school of R. Ishmael taught,<br>Scripture said, ‘upon that<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> which is with the clean’,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> implying, whatever is in the hand of him that<br>is clean,<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> I have declared it to be unclean to you.<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> But might it not be suggested that by carriage it<br>conveys uncleanness to the man and his garments while by contact it conveys uncleanness to man<br>only but not to his garments, this law being similar to that of the touch of nebelah? — Resh Lakish<br>replied and so it was also taught at the school of R. Ishmael: Scripture said, ‘upon that which is with<br>the clean’<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> implying that that which I have declared to you as clean elsewhere I have declared to<br>you as unclean here, and what is this? It is the touch of nebelah.<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> But might it not be suggested that<br>this<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> refers to<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> the carrying of a dead creeping thing?<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> — If that were so, Scripture should have<br>written, ‘upon that which is with a man’,<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> why then did it write ‘upon that which is with the<br>clean’?<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> Consequently the two deductions may be made.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup><br>‘And nasal discharge’. What [uncleanness] is [there in a] nasal discharge?<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> — Rab replied: This<br>is the case where it was drawn and discharged through the mouth,<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> since in the circumstances it is<br>impossible for the nasal secretion to be free from particles of spittle. R. Johanan, however, stated that<br>it is unclean even if it is drawn and discharged through the nose. It is thus clear that he is of the<br>opinion that the nose is a source,<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> the All Merciful<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> having included it.<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> As to Rab,<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> why should<br>not the tears of a zab's eyes<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> be enumerated?<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> For<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> has not Rab stated, He who wishes to blind his<br>eye shall have it painted by an idolater,<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> and Levi stated, He who wishes to die shall have his eyes<br>painted by an idolater, and in connection with this R. Hiyya b. Goria explained, ‘What is Rab's<br>reason for not saying \"He who wishes to die [etc.]\"? Because one might sniff them up and discharge<br>them, through the mouth’.<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> Now<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> what is Rab's explanation?<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> — Granted that the poison is<br>discharged,<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> the tears themselves are not so discharged.<br>Come and hear: ‘There are nine fluids of<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> a zab. His sweat, foul secretion and excrement are free<br>from all uncleanness of zibah; the tears of his eye, the blood of his wound and the milk of a woman<br>convey the uncleanness of liquids<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> if they consist of a minimum quantity of a quarter of a log; but<br>his zibah, his spittle and his urine<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> convey major uncleanness’;<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> but nasal discharge was not<br>mentioned. Now according to Rab<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> one can well see why this was not mentioned, since it was not<br>definite enough to be mentioned, for it is only sometimes that it is discharged through the mouth<br>while at other times it is discharged through the nose;<sup>6</sup><sup>4</sup> but according to R. Johanan<sup>6</sup><sup>5</sup> why was it not<br>mentioned? — But according to your view,<sup>6</sup><sup>6</sup> was his mucus and phlegm<sup>6</sup><sup>7</sup> mentioned?<sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup> But the fact<br>is that spittle was mentioned and the same law applies to all other secretions the law of whose<br>uncleanness was derived from the Pentateuchal amplification,<sup>6</sup><sup>9</sup> and so also here<sup>7</sup><sup>0</sup> spittle was<br>mentioned and all other secretions the law of whose uncleanness was derived from the amplification<br>are also included. ‘The tears of his eye’ [is legally a fluid] since it is written in Scripture, And given<br>them tears to drink in large measure,<sup>7</sup><sup>1</sup> ‘the blood of his wound’, since it is written, And drink the<br>blood of the slain,<sup>7</sup><sup>2</sup> and there is no difference<sup>7</sup><sup>3</sup> between striking one down outright or striking one<br>down in part;<sup>7</sup><sup>4</sup> ‘the milk of a woman’, since it is written, And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave<br>him drink.<sup>7</sup><sup>5</sup> Whence do we derive the law that ‘his urine’ [is legally a fluid]? — It was taught: His<br>issue is unclean, and this<sup>7</sup><sup>6</sup> includes his urine in respect of uncleanness. But may not this<sup>7</sup><sup>7</sup> be arrived<br>at by a logical argument? If spittle, that emanates from a region of cleanness, is unclean how much<br>more so his urine that emanates<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Cf. Lev.

        "from an unclean region?<sup>1</sup> — The blood that issues from the orifice of the membrum<sup>2</sup> could prove the<br>contrary, for though it issues from an unclean region it is nevertheless clean; you also need not,<br>therefore, be surprised at this that, though it issues from an unclean region, it should be clean. Hence<br>it was explicitly stated, ‘His issue is unclean and this’, to include his urine in respect of uncleanness.<br>Whence is it deduced that the blood that issues from the orifice of the membrum<sup>2</sup> is clean? — From<br>what was taught It might have been assumed that blood that issues from his<sup>2</sup> mouth or from the<br>orifice of the membrum is unclean,<sup>3</sup> hence it was explicitly stated, As to his issue it is unclean,<sup>4</sup> only<br>‘it’ is unclean, but blood that issues from his mouth or from his membrum is not unclean but clean.<sup>5</sup><br>But might I not reverse the deductions?<sup>6</sup> — R. Johanan citing R. Simeon b. Yohai replied: It<sup>7</sup> must<br>be similar to spittle; as spittle is formed in globules when it is discharged so must any other unclean<br>fluid be one that is formed in globules when it is discharged; blood is, therefore, excluded since it is<br>not formed in globules when it is discharged. But is not a woman's milk formed in globules when it<br>is discharged and the Master nevertheless stated that ‘a woman's milk conveys the uncleanness of<br>liquids’ which implies: Only<sup>8</sup> the uncleanness of liquids but not major uncleanness? — Rather said<br>R. Johanan citing R. Simeon b. Yohai: It<sup>7</sup> must be similar to spittle, as spittle is formed in globules<br>when discharged but<sup>9</sup> may be re-absorbed, so must any other unclean fluid be one that is formed in<br>globules when discharged and that<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> may be re-absorbed; blood is, therefore, excluded since it is not<br>formed in globules when it is discharged, and a woman's milk is excluded since, though it is formed<br>in globules when discharged, it cannot be re-absorbed. But why should not deduction be made from<br>the zab's issue: As his issue which is not formed in globules when it is discharged causes<br>uncleanness so does any other fluid?<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> — Raba replied: One cannot make a deduction from his issue,<br>since it also causes uncleanness to others.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup><br>A DEAD CREEPING THING. Resh Lakish ruled: A dead creeping thing that dried up but whose<br>shape was retained is unclean. But have we not learnt that they CONVEY UNCLEANNESS WHEN<br>WET BUT NOT WHEN DRY? — R. Zera replied: This is no difficulty since the former<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> refers to a<br>whole<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> while the latter<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> refers to a part;<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> for it was taught: R. Isaac son of R. Bisna citing R.<br>Simeon b.

The one<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> refers to a wet creeping thing while the other<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> refers to a dry one. Raba ruled:<br>The lizards of Mahuza,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> if their shapes are retained, are unclean.<br>Resh Lakish further stated: If a dead creeping thing was burnt while its shape was retained it is<br>unclean. An objection was raised: If a burnt creeping thing was found upon olives and so also if a<br>tattered rag<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> was found upon them they are clean, because all questions of uncleanness are<br>determined by the condition of the objects at the time they are found!<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> — R.

JOSE RULED: THE FLESH OF A CORPSE etc. Samuel explained: It is CLEAN in so far only<br>as not to convey uncleanness if it is of the bulk of an olive, but it does convey the uncleanness of<br>corpse mould.<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> So it was also taught: R. Jose ruled, The flesh of a corpse that is dry and, on being<br>soaked, cannot return to its original condition is clean in so far only as not to convey uncleanness if<br>it is of the bulk of an olive but it is subject to the uncleanness of corpse-mould.<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup><br><b>MISHNAH</b>.

        "Or also in the case where the creeping thing was found in a hole.<sup>1</sup> If you say that ‘it is in the<br>presumptive state of having been duly examined’, any one who examines the alley examines also<br>any hole in it; but if you say that ‘it is in the presumptive state of having been properly swept’, a hole<br>is not usually swept.<sup>2</sup><br>SO ALSO A BLOODSTAIN etc. The question was raised: Is the shirt TO SUCH TIME AS IT<br>WAS LAST WASHED in the presumptive state of having been duly examined,<sup>3</sup> or is it possible that<br>it is in the presumptive state of having been properly washed?<sup>4</sup> And in what case could this<sup>5</sup> matter?<br>— In that where a person declared that he had washed the shirt but did not examine it — If you say<br>that ‘it is in the presumptive state of having been duly examined’, surely, he had not examined it,<sup>6</sup><br>but if you say that ‘it is in the presumptive state of having been properly washed’, surely, it had been<br>properly washed.<sup>7</sup> Or also in the case where the stain was discovered in a fold.<sup>8</sup> If you say that ‘it is<br>in the presumptive state of having been duly examined’, anyone engaged in an examination<br>examines also the folds,<sup>9</sup> but if you say that ‘it is in the presumptive state of having been properly<br>washed’, a stain in a fold may not have been washed out.<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> Now what is the decision? — Come and<br>hear: For it was taught: R. Meir stated, Why did they<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> rule that if a dead creeping thing was found<br>in an alley it causes uncleanness retrospectively to such time as one can testify, ‘I examined this<br>alley and there was no creeping thing in it’, or to such time as it was last swept?<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> Because there is<br>presumption that the children of Israel examine their alleys at the time they are swept; but if they did<br>not examine them, they impaired its presumptive cleanness retrospectively.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> And why did they<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup><br>rule that a bloodstain, if found on a shirt, causes uncleanness retrospectively to such time as one can<br>testify, ‘I examined this shirt and there was no stain on it’, or to such time as it was last washed?<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup><br>Because there is presumption that the daughters of Israel examine their shirts at the time they are<br>washing them; but if they did not examine them, they impair its presumptive cleanness<br>retrospectively.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> R. Aha ruled: Let her<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> wash it again. If its colour fades<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> it may be taken for<br>granted<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> that it was made after the previous washing,<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> but if it does not fade it may be taken for<br>granted<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> that it was made before the previous washing. Rabbi said, A stain after its washing is not<br>like a stain before it had been washed, for the former penetrates into the material while the latter<br>remains clotted on its surface. Thus it may be inferred<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> that<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> there is presumption that it was duly<br>examined. This is conclusive.<br>AND IT CAUSES UNCLEANNESS IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER IT IS WET etc. R. Eleazar<br>explained: This<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> was learnt only concerning the dead creeping thing, but a wet bloodstain also<br>causes uncleanness retrospectively,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> for it might be assumed that it was already dry but water had<br>fallen upon it. But can it not be assumed in the case of a dead creeping thing also that it was already<br>dry but water had fallen upon it? — If that were the case it would have been completely<br>dismembered.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup><br><b>MISHNAH</b>.

If one of the branches overshadowed a grave, uncleanness is conveyed only to a person under it but not<br>to one under any of the other branches; but when the exact spot of the grave is unknown all the area overshadowed by<br>the foliage is on account of the doubt subject to the same restriction. A Samaritan who is lax in the observance of<br>uncleanness in a doubtful case, is not to be relied upon when he states that the grave was overshadowed by a particular<br>branch or branches and that the others did not overshadow it.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Cf. prev. n. mut. mut.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) Who desires to remain clean while making his way through a beth peras.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Since no flesh of the corpse need be expected, while the bones which the plough crushed (v. infra) to fractions<br>convey uncleanness (if they are no smaller than a barley-grain) only by means of touch or carriage.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) A grave area, v.

Aliter: ‘Peras’ means a<br>‘half’, the extent of the unclean area being half a furrow in each direction from the grave. Aliter: ‘Peras’ is derived from<br>a root meaning ‘to extend’, the uncleanness being extended to an area larger than that of the grave.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Which means a hundred times a hundred cubits.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) The Samaritans.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) About a beth ha-peras.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) And which also, like a field in which a grave was ploughed, is subject to the uncleanness of a beth ha-peras (cf.<br>M.K. <sup>5</sup>b).<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) Sc. in any particular spot in the field.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) Which is subject to Pentateuchal uncleanness which Samaritans observe. As his evidence amounts to an assertion<br>that no Pentateuchal uncleanness is involved in that particular place he may well be relied upon. How then is this to be<br>reconciled with our Mishnah?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) Cf. supra p. <sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup><sup>9</sup>, n. <sup>2</sup>.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) Under any particular branch.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) The cited Baraitha according to which a Samaritan is relied upon.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) Which may well be taken as reliable evidence that there was no grave there. Our Mishnah, however, refers to a case<br>where the Samaritan walks only across a part of the field. As he omits the other part there is reason to suspect that he<br>knows it to contain a grave and that his evidence on the doubtful part of the field is intended to mislead Israelites so that<br>they become subject to an uncleanness in which he himself does not believe. Hence the ruling of our Mishnah.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) That the Samaritan walked throughout the suspected area.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) A rule that is self evident. As a grave was known to have been in the field and the Samaritan nevertheless walked<br>through all its area, it must be obvious that he knew that the corpse had been removed.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) From the field; and that he assumed the grave to be located within that strip. As the rest of the field is still a<br>suspected area the doubtful uncleanness of which Samaritans disregard his evidence aught not to be relied upon.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) Since he walked across its four sides.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) The possibility of a narrow strip jutting out not being taken into consideration.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) Which are a Rabbinical institution. Samaritans who reject it are not trusted when they state where the limit is.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup>) Yen nesek, wine touched by an idolater and suspected of having been dedicated by him to idolatry.

When she<br>stands, the urine might well return to the interior of her womb<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> and then carry out some blood with<br>it, but if she sits,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> she remains clean.<br>Come and hear: If on a testing rag that was placed under a pillow some blood was found, it is<br>regarded as clean if it<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> was round,<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> but if it was elongated it is unclean. Now how are we to<br>understand the circumstances? If she felt a discharge, why should it be clean when round?<br>Consequently it must be a case where she felt no discharge, and yet it was stated, was it not, that if it<br>was elongated it is unclean?<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> — No, it may in fact be a case where<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> she felt the discharge, but it<br>might be assumed that it was the feeling of the testing rag. Hence if it is elongated it must certainly<br>have issued from her body.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> but if it is round<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> it is clean.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup><br>Come and hear: If a vestige of blood is found on his rag they are both unclean and are also under<br>the obligation of bringing a sacrifice. If any blood is found on her rag immediately after their<br>intercourse they are both unclean and are also under the obligation of bringing a sacrifice. If,<br>however, any blood is found on her rag after a time they are both unclean by reason of the doubt but<br>exempt from the sacrifice.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> Now how are we to imagine the circumstance? If she has felt a<br>discharge, why should they be exempt from the sacrifice where the blood is found after a time? Must<br>it not then be a case where she did not feel any discharge, and yet it was taught, was it not, that ‘if<br>any blood is found on her rag immediately after their intercourse they are both unclean and are also<br>under the obligation of bringing a sacrifice’?<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> — No, she may in fact have felt the discharge, but it<br>might be assumed that it was the feeling of the attendant.<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup><br>Come and hear: You are thus in a position<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> to say that three forms of doubt appertain to a<br>woman. A bloodstain on her body, concerning which there is doubt whether it is unclean and clean,<br>is regarded as unclean;<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> on her shirt, when it is doubtful whether it is unclean or clean, is regarded<br>as clean;<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> and in regard to the laws of the uncleanness of contact and heset<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> you follow the<br>majority. Now what is meant by ‘you follow the majority’? Is it not that if on most days she is<br>unclean<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> this is a cause of uncleanness<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> even when she felt no discharge?<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> — No, the meaning is<br>that if on most days her observation of the blood is accompanied by a feeling of the discharge she is<br>unclean since it might be assumed that she had felt it this time also but did not pay any attention to it.<br>The Master said, ‘A bloodstain on her body, concerning which there is doubt whether it is unclean<br>or clean, is regarded as unclean; on her shirt, when it is doubtful whether it is unclean or clean, is<br>regarded as clean’. How is one to understand the circumstances? If it<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> was below her belt, why,<br>when on her shirt, is it regarded as clean seeing that we have learnt, BELOW THE BELT, SHE IS<br>UNCLEAN; and if it was above her belt, why, when on her body is it regarded as unclean, seeing<br>that we have learnt that if she observed blood on her body, IF IT WAS NOT NEAR THE<br>PUDENDA, SHE REMAINS CLEAN? — If you wish I could reply that the stain was below the<br>belt; and if you prefer I might reply that it was above the belt. ‘If you wish I could reply that the stain<br>was below the belt’, in a case, for instance, where she passed through a butchers’ market. If the stain<br>was on her body it must have emanated from herself, for if it had emanated from an external source<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup><br>it should have been found on her shirt; but if it is found on her shirt, it must have emanated from an<br>external source,<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> for if it had emanated from herself it should have been found on her body. ‘And if<br>you prefer I might reply that it was above her belt’, in a case, for instance, where she jumped<br>backwards. If the stain is on her body it must undoubtedly have emanated from herself, for if it had<br>emanated from an external source<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> it should have been found on her shirt; but if it is found on her<br>shirt, it must have emanated from an external source,<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> for if it had emanated from herself, it should<br>have been found on her body. At all events, it was stated, was it not, ‘A bloodstain on her body,<br>concerning which there is doubt whether it is unclean or clean, is regarded as clean’, presumably<br>even if she did not feel any discharge?<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> Furthermore, we have learnt, IF A WOMAN OBSERVED<br>A BLOODSTAIN ON HER BODY. IF IT WAS NEAR THE PUDENDA, SHE IS UNCLEAN.<br>Does not this imply even where she did not feel any discharge?<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> — R.

        "according to Rabbinic law.<sup>1</sup> R. Ashi<sup>2</sup> replied: Samuel gave his ruling in accordance with the view of<br>R. Nehemiah. For we learnt: R. Nehemiah ruled, Any thing that is not susceptible to uncleanness is<br>not susceptible to stains.<sup>3</sup> According to R. Ashi one can well see the reason why he<sup>4</sup> mentioned<br>‘ground’,<sup>5</sup> but according to R.Jeremiah of Difti,<sup>6</sup> what was the point of mentioning ‘ground’, seeing<br>that even in the case of a cloak<sup>7</sup> the woman is subject to the same law? — This is a case of an<br>implied climax:<sup>8</sup> There is no question [that the woman is clean where she sat on] a cloak since it<br>cannot be thoroughly examined and one may, therefore, well assume [that the stain] emanated from<br>an external source,<sup>9</sup> but even [where she sat on] the ground which can well be thoroughly<br>examined,<sup>9</sup> and where<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> it might justifiably be assumed that it emanated from her body, she is<br>nevertheless regarded as clean.<br>ON HER HEEL OR ON THE TIP OF HER GREAT TOE. SHE IS UNCLEAN etc. One can well<br>concede that HER HEEL<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> is likely<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> to come in contact with that place,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> but what is the reason for<br>the uncleanness in the case of a stain on THE TIP OF HER GREAT TOE? And should you reply: It<br>might sometimes touch her heel [the objection would arise]: Do we [as regards] uncleanness<br>presume transfer from place to place? Was it not in fact taught: If she<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> had a wound on her neck in a<br>position to which the blood stain might be attributed,<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> she may so attribute it;<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> if it was on her<br>shoulder, in which case she cannot so attribute it,<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> she must not so attribute it; and we do not<br>suggest that it is possible that she had taken it<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> with her hand and transferred it there?<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> — The fact<br>rather is that THE TIP OF HER TOE is in a different category.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> because [direct dropping of blood]<br>might occur while she is walking. But do we not [as regards] uncleanness presume transfer from<br>place to place? Was it not in fact taught: If it<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> was found on her finger joints.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> she is unclean,<br>because hands are active.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> Now what is the reason?<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> Is it not this: That we assume that she had<br>examined herself with one hand<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> and then touched it with her other hand?<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> — No, her hand is<br>different<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> since all of it might come in direct contact<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> [with the menstrual source].<br>ON HER THIGH OR ON HER FEET, IF ON THEIR INNER SIDE etc. How far<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> ON THEIR<br>INNER SIDE?<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> — The school of R. Jannai replied: As far as the place of hebek.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> The question<br>was asked: Is the place of the hebek.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> regarded as the inner, or as the outer side? — Come and hear<br>what R. Kattina learnt: As far as the place of the hebek, and the hebek itself is regarded as the inner<br>side. R. Hiyya son of R. Iwya taught this<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> explicitly: The School of R. Jannai ruled, As far as the<br>place of the hebek and the hebek itself is regarded as in the inner side.<br>R. Jeremiah enquired: What is the ruling<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> where a bloodstain had the shape of a ring, of a straight<br>line of drops,<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> or of a splash of drops.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> or where it runs across the breadth of her thigh? — Come<br>and hear: ‘A bloodstain on her body concerning which there is doubt whether it is unclean or clean,<br>is regarded as unclean’. Now does not ‘on her body’ imply stains of such shapes? — No, it might<br>only refer to one that is shaped like a stripe.<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup><br>A woman once found blood on her web. When she came to R. Jannai<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> he told her to experiment<br>by repeating<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> her forward and backward movements.<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> But was it not taught: No repetition [test is<br>recognized] in questions of cleanness?<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> — We say that no repetition test is recognized only<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> where<br>the law would thereby<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> be relaxed, but where it is thereby restricted we do recognize a test of<br>repetition.<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup><br>IF SHE TAKES IT OFF etc. It was taught: R. Eleazar son of R. Jose stated, In such a case<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> I gave<br>a ruling in the city of Rome imposing a prohibition,<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> and when I came to the Sages of the South<br>they said to me, ‘You have given the right decision.<br>Our Rabbis taught: Where a tall woman put on the shirt<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> of a short woman or if a short one put on<br>the shirt<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> of a tall one, if [a blood stain]<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> corresponds to the position of the pudenda of the tall one,<br>they are both unclean, but if it does not correspond to it,<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> the tall one is clean while the short one is<br>unclean. Another Baraitha taught: If a woman examined her shirt<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> and then<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> lent it to her friend,<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup><br>she is clean, but her friend may attribute it<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> to her. R.

        "But why is this case different from the following where it was taught: If two women were engaged in<br>the preparation of one bird which contained no more than one sela’ of blood, and then a stain of the<br>size of a sela’ was found on each, they are both unclean?<sup>1</sup> — There<sup>2</sup> the law is different since there<br>was an additional sela’.<sup>3</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: Where a woman put on three shirts<sup>4</sup> that she had previously examined<sup>5</sup> [and<br>then found blood on one of them]. if she is in a position to attribute [the blood to an external source]<sup>6</sup><br>she may do so even though [the blood was found] on the lowest shirt, but if she is not in a position to<br>attribute [it to an external cause]<sup>6</sup> she may not do so even though [the blood was found] on the<br>uppermost shirt.

Only where SHE KILLED<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> but not where she did not kill any.<br>Whose view then does our Mishnah<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> represent? — That of R. Simeon b. Gamaliel. For it was<br>taught: If she killed a louse she may attribute a bloodstain to it, but if she did not kill any she may<br>not so attribute it; so R. Simeon b. Gamaliel. But the Sages ruled: In either case she may attribute the<br>one to the other. Said R. Simeon b. Gamaliel: According to my view there is no limit<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> and<br>according to the view of my colleagues there is no end.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> ‘According to my view there is no limit’<br>since you could hardly find<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> a woman who could be regarded as clean for her husband, seeing that<br>there is hardly<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> a bed that does not contain ever so many drops of louse blood.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> ‘According to the<br>view of my colleagues there is no end’, since there is hardly<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> a woman who could be regarded as<br>unclean for her husband, seeing that there is hardly a sheet on which there are not ever so many<br>drops of blood;<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> but the view of R. Hanina b. Antigonus is more feasible than mine and theirs, for<br>he has laid down, ‘How large a stain may be attributed to a louse? One not bigger than the size of a<br>split bean’,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> and we rule in agreement with his view.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> But according to the Rabbis who ruled, SHE<br>MAY ATTRIBUTE,<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> how large may be the stain?<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> — R. Nahman b. Isaac replied: She may<br>attribute it to a bed-bug even if it is as big as a lupine.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: A<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> bed-bug is of the same length and breadth and the taste of it is like its<br>odour. Whosoever crushes it cannot help<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> smelling it. It was stated to be of ‘the same length and<br>breadth’ in regard to bloodstains.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> ‘The taste of it is like its odour’ has been stated in regard to<br>terumah.<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> For we have learnt: ‘Or if he tasted the flavour of a bed-bug in his mouth he must spit it<br>out.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> But how could he know this?<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> Because ‘the taste of it is like its odour’. But still, whence<br>could he know this?<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> [Because] ‘whosoever crushes it cannot help<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> smelling it’.<br>R. Ashi ruled: In a town in which there are pigs there is no need to consider the possibility of<br>menstrual bloodstains.<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> R. Nahman b. Isaac stated: The condition of<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> Dokereth<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> is<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> like that of a<br>town in which there are pigs.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup><br>HOW LARGE A STAIN MAY BE ATTRIBUTED etc. R. Huna explained: If the stain is equal in<br>size to a split bean it may not be attributed to a louse; if it is smaller in size than a split bean it may<br>be attributed to it. R. Hisda, however, explained: If it was of the same size as a split bean it may be<br>attributed to it, but if it was bigger than the size of a split bean it may not be attributed to it. Must it<br>be assumed that they<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> differ on the question whether UP TO’ is meant to include the terminus,<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> R.<br>Huna<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> holding the opinion that ‘up to’ does not include the terminus<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> while R. Hisda<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> holds that<br>‘up to’ is inclusive of the terminus?<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> — R. Huna can answer you: ‘Up to’ may sometimes include<br>the terminus and sometimes exclude it, but in either case<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> the meaning must be one that leads to a<br>restriction,<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> while R. Hisda can answer you: Elsewhere I agree with you<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> that we adopt a meaning<br>that leads to a restriction and not one that leads to a relaxation, but here the meaning must be in<br>agreement with a ruling of R. Abbahu, R. Abbahu having ruled: All prescribed minima of the Sages<br>are intended to impose restrictions, except the prescribed size of a split bean in the case of<br>bloodstains which is intended to relax the law.<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> There are others who give this tradition<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> as an<br>independent statement:<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> R.

Hisda ruled, One of the size of a split bean is treated<br>as one that is less than the size of a split bean;<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> but they differ on the interpretation of UP TO here,<br>as has just been explained.<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup><br>An objection was raised:<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Sc. as in this case, though one stain could well be attributed to the bird, both women are unclean, so also in the<br>former case, since it is possible that the lender did not properly examine her shirt, both lender and borrower should be<br>unclean.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) The latter case.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Which cannot possibly be attributed to the bird.

        "If a woman had drops of blood on her body below her belt<sup>1</sup> and drops of blood above it, she may<br>attribute [the former to the blood that is assumed to be the cause of the drops] on the latter<sup>2</sup> up to the<br>size of a split bean. Now does not this<sup>3</sup> mean a stain of the size of a split bean below her belt?<sup>4</sup> —<br>No, a stain of the size of a split bean above the belt.<sup>5</sup><br>It was stated: If on the body of a woman<sup>6</sup> was found a stain of the size of a split bean plus some<br>addition,<sup>7</sup> and to that addition clung a louse, R. Hanina ruled: She is unclean;<sup>8</sup> and R.Jannai ruled:<br>She is clean.<sup>9</sup> ‘R. Hanina ruled: She is unclean’, since she may attribute a stain to a louse only where<br>the former is of the size of a split bean but not where it is of the size of a split bean plus. ‘R. Jannai<br>ruled: She is clean’, since this restriction<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> applies only where no louse clings to the addition, but<br>where a louse clings to it, it is quite evident that the addition is the blood of a louse, so that only a<br>stain of the size of a split bean remains;<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> and since such a size may elsewhere<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> be attributed to a<br>louse it may also here be so attributed.<br>R. Jeremiah enquired: What is the ruling where a woman handled some blood of the bulk of a split<br>bean but on her body was found a bloodstain of the size of a split bean and a little more? This<br>question arises according to R. Hanina and it also arises according to R. Jannai. ‘This question arises<br>according to R. Hanina’, since R. Hanina may have maintained his view there<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> that the woman was<br>unclean, only because she did not handle any blood, but here, where she did handle some, she may<br>well attribute [the stain to an extraneous cause].<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> or is it possible that, even according to R. Jannai<br>who ruled<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> that she was clean, the ruling applies only where a louse clings to the stain, but where no<br>louse clings to it, the stain may not be attributed to it? — Come and hear: If she was handling red<br>stuff she may not attribute to it a black stain; if she was handling a small quantity<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> she may not<br>attribute to it a large stain. Now how is one to imagine the circumstances?<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> Would you not agree<br>that they were of the same nature?<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> — No, this<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> might be a case, for instance, where she handled a<br>quantity of blood of the bulk of a split bean while on her body was found a stain of the size of two<br>split beans and a little more in excess.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> But if so,<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> what was the need of mentioning it?<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> — It<br>might have been presumed that one takes the part of the stain<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> that may be attributed to the blood of<br>the bird<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> to be in the middle<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> so that there remains less than the prescribed minimum on either of<br>its sides,<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> hence we were informed [that the stain cannot be attributed to it<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> at all].<br>Raba ruled: If one kind of material<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> was found upon a woman<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> she may attribute to it any kind<br>of stain.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> It was objected: If she was handling red stuff she may not attribute to it a black stain!<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> —<br>A case where she had handled the stuff is different.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> There are some who say: Raba ruled, If a<br>woman was handling one kind of material, she may attribute to it any kinds of stain.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> It was<br>objected: If she was handling red stuff she may not attribute to it a black stain!<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> — When Raba laid<br>down his ruling he referred to a woman who was handling a hen which contains several kinds of<br>blood.<br>A WOMAN ONCE etc. But was it not taught: Seeing that the Sages did not lay down the rule in<br>order to relax the law but rather to restrict it?<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> — Rabina replied: The meaning is that they did not<br>lay down the rule to relax Pentateuchal laws,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> but rather to add restrictions to them;<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> but the<br>uncleanness of bloodstains is altogether a Rabbinical enactment.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup><br>IF ON A TESTING RAG THAT WAS PLACED. The question was raised: Do the Rabbis differ<br>from R. Eliezer son of R. Zadok or not? — Come and hear: A long stain is counted<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> but scattered<br>drops are not combined.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> Now whose view does this represent? If it be suggested: That of R. Eliezer<br>son of R. Zadok [the difficulty would arise:] Why was there need<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> for the combination, seeing that<br>he ruled that even a stain that was only slightly elongated is unclean. Must we not then conclude that<br>it represents the view of the Rabbis? Thus it follows, does it not, that they differ from his view? —<br>No, this may indeed represent the view of R. Eliezer son of R. Zadok, for he laid down the law<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> in<br>regard to a testing rag<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> but not in regard to a bloodstain.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup><br>Come and hear<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> what Rab Judah citing Samuel stated: ‘The halachah is in agreement with R.<br>Eliezer son of R. Zadok’. Now since the halachah had to be declared it follows that they<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> differ<br>from him.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> This is conclusive. [<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) So Tosaf. and Tosaf. Asheri, (contra Rashi) whose interpretation is here followed.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Lit., ‘on the upper’. As the drops above the belt may be attributed to blood from a source external to her body so may<br>also the drops below it.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) The prescribed ‘size of a split bean’.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) But if so, it would follow that only where there are bloodstains above the belt are stains of the size of a split bean<br>below it regarded as originating from the same extraneous source as those above and, therefore, treated as clean, but that<br>where there are no drops of blood above the belt, even a stain of the size of a split bean below it is regarded as unclean.<br>An objection against R. Hisda who ruled that a stain of such size is invariably attributed to vermin and is, therefore,<br>clean.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Sc. so long as the stain above is not smaller than the size of a split bean the stain below, though bigger than the size<br>of a split bean, may be attributed to the same cause as that of the stain above. When the stain below, however, is no<br>bigger than the size of a split bean, it is invariably clean irrespective of whether the body above was or was not stained<br>with drops of blood.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Lit., ‘upon her’.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Lit., ‘and more’.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) It being regarded as due to menstrual blood.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Sc. it is not attributed to blood of menstruation.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) That only a stain no bigger than a split bean is attributed to a louse.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) In doubt as to its origin.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Where there is no addition to it.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) In the statement just cited.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) One part of the stain, to the extent of the size of a bean, might be attributed to the blood of the same quantity that<br>she had previously handled while the remainder might be attributed to some vermin.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) Of the blood of a bird (cf. infra).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) In the latter case.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) As the case submitted by R. Jeremiah. Would then a solution be forthcoming from here?<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) As the excess over the size of a split bean amounts to more than a split bean, it cannot possibly be attributed to<br>vermin. Hence the uncleanness.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Cf. prev. n.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) A ruling that is self-evident.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) The size of one split bean.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Cf. supra n. <sup>5</sup>.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘take like the size of a split bean; threw it in the middle’ of the stained area.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Lit., ‘go here there is no prescribed size (bis)’. As the stain is thus smaller than the size prescribed it might have<br>been presumed to be clean.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) The blood of the bird.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Collyrium or sap, for instance, which leaves a stain after it is removed.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) Lit., ‘upon her’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) That she subsequently discovers; though the latter is not of the same colour as the material to which it is attributed.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) How then can Raba maintain that a stain of any colour may be attributed to any stuff that was previously found on<br>the woman?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) From where, unknown to herself, something had clung to her body. In this latter case, since she was unaware of the<br>particular stuff that clung to her, she may well be presumed to have been unaware also of the presence upon her of the<br>substance from which the stain had originated. In the former case, however, where she had handled a red substance and<br>was fully aware of it no ground for such an assumption exists.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Cf. prev. n. but one mut. mut.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) An objection against R.

The reference is to a<br>woman who sat on the rim of a bowl, discharging into the bowl, and blood was found within the<br>bowl, [in which case it is obvious] that if the blood had issued after the water had ceased to flow it<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup><br>should have been found on the rim of the bowl.<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> Samuel ruled or, as some say, Rab Judah citing<br>Samuel ruled: The halachah is in agreement with R.

Whence is this<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> inferred? — Since it was not stated:<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> R. Meir and R.<br>Jose<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> ruled that she remains clean’. If so,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> [the difficulty arises:] Now that R.

But, instead of<br>disputing about such a case involving only one doubt in order to inform you how far reaching is the<br>ruling of R.

Meir?<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> The power of a lenient view<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> is preferred.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup><br>R. Johanan, however, replied: R. Meir gave his ruling<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> only where one doubt is involved, but where<br>a double doubt is involved<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> he did not maintain his view. But if so,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> why was it not stated:<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> R.<br>Meir and R.

It was taught in<br>agreement with R. Johanan: If a man and a woman attended to their needs in the same bowl and<br>blood was found on the water, R. Meir and R. Jose declared it clean and R.

Rab explained: The reference<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> is to a GENTILE WOMAN<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Making water.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) This is discussed in the Gemara infra.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Who regards the blood as clean even where, as in the first clause, only one doubt is involved, viz., whether the blood<br>originated in the menstrual source or in a wound in the bladder.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Since in addition to the doubt mentioned (cf. prev. n.) there is also the one whether the blood issued from the woman<br>or from the man. The necessity for this ruling will be discussed infra in the Gemara.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Whence the menstrual blood issues.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Sc. in the natural manner, no strain being involved in the process. Only when a strain is involved (as where the<br>woman is standing or where the discharge is slow) is it likely for the urine to return to the source and to re-issue mixed<br>with blood, but not where the discharge is flowing normally and easily.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Though the urine does not return to the source.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) From the menstrual source, independently of the other discharge.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Why then is the woman regarded as clean?<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Since the discharge of blood is not bow-shaped.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) As, however, it was found within the bowl it must be assumed to have found its way there together with the water.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) A person who sought ‘his opinion on the question.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) When attending to their needs; and blood was found in the bowl.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Lit. ‘what, to me, said’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) Who (v. our Mishnah) regards a woman as unclean if she was standing alone.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) cf. prev. n.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Whether the blood emanated from the menstrual source or from a wound in the bladder.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Lit., ‘doubt of a doubt’. Firstly there is the doubt whether the blood emanated from the woman or from the man; and<br>secondly, even if it emanated from the woman, there remains the doubt previously mentioned (cf. prev. n.).<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) That the woman is unclean.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Resh Lakish's statement.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) In our Mishnah in the case where A MAN AND A WOMAN ATTENDED etc.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Instead of the latter name alone.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) That even in the latter case, where a double doubt is involved (cf. n. <sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>). R. Meir holds the woman to be unclean.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Cf. prev. n.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) In the first clause of our Mishnah.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Apparently not. For if the woman is unclean in the case of a double doubt it is obvious that she is unclean in the<br>case of one doubt. Why then was R.

Jose that the woman is clean.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) In our Mishnah in the case where A MAN AND A WOMAN ATTENDED etc.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) Instead of the latter name alone.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) Lit., ‘yes, thus also’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) At the conclusion of the preceding clause.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) The clause under discussion.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) In the first clause of our Mishnah.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) Cf. supra p. <sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>, n. <sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) Where the woman, for instance, had already handled clean things.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) Sc. if she had not yet come in contact with clean things she is to be ordered to keep away from them.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) By the additional and apparently superfluous clause.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) Alone.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) When attending to her needs; and blood was found in the bowl.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) Lit., ‘what, to me, said’.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup>) Lit., ‘the world is pressed for her’. As a result of the narrowness of the passage blood from the menstrual source<br>might well be presumed to issue together with the returned urine, and since this presumption almost amounts to a<br>certainty there remains no more than one doubt, as to whether the blood emanated from the man or the woman, which<br>well justifies R. Simeon's ruling that the blood is unclean.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup>) And the passage allowed of the free movement of the urine. Any blood discharged in this case might well be<br>attributed to a wound in the bladder, and, therefore, regarded as clean.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup>) When attending to their needs; and blood was found in the bowl.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>) And the presumption that the blood emanated from the menstrual source is then so strong that, despite the double<br>doubt involved, R. Simeon, disregarding one of the doubts, maintains his view.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup>) Whether (a) the blood issued from the woman or the man and (b) if from the woman whether from the menstrual<br>source or from some internal wound.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup>) Which clearly indicates that he never attributes it to the man.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup>) The man and the woman.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup>) That was found on it after she herself had worn it.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup>) Lit., ‘on her’; and she remains clean. Such a presumption is permitted since neither the gentile woman nor the<br>menstruant is thereby placed at a disadvantage, the former being free from the restrictions in any case while the latter is<br>already in a state of uncleanness.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup>) Since each one might be presumed to have been the cause.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup>) Which, unlike a wooden one, is not susceptible to uncleanness.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup>) [The same applies to one woman sitting on a stone bench etc. The plural is used here in continuation of the<br>preceding clause. v. Strashun].<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup>) Sc. no uncleanness of the person is assumed by reason of a stain that was found on it. This is further explained in<br>the Gemara infra.<br>(<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup>) In our Mishnah.",
        "who once experienced a discharge.<sup>1</sup> Whence is this derived? From the fact that she is placed on a par<br>with A MENSTRUANT. As the menstruant is a woman who experienced a discharge<sup>1</sup> so must the<br>GENTILE WOMAN be one who experienced a discharge.<sup>1</sup> R. Shesheth remarked, Rab must have<br>made this statement when he was lying down and about to doze, for it was taught: ‘She may attribute<br>it<sup>2</sup> to the gentile woman.<sup>3</sup> R. Meir said, To the gentile woman who is capable of a menstrual<br>discharge’,<sup>4</sup> Now even R. Meir<sup>5</sup> only spoke of one who is ‘capable of a menstrual discharge’ but did<br>not require one who actually experienced a discharge.<sup>6</sup> Raba retorted: But do you understand R.<br>Meir to restrict the law?<sup>7</sup> R. Meir in fact relaxes it. For it was taught: ‘She may not attribute it<sup>8</sup> to the<br>gentile woman. R. Meir ruled: She may attribute it to her’.<sup>9</sup> But, then, does not a difficulty arise<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup><br>from the former?<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> — Explain thus:<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> Only when she<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> experienced a discharge once before; and R.<br>Meir said, If she is capable of a menstrual discharge even though she never yet experienced one.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: A woman may attribute a stain<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> to another woman<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> who was awaiting a day<br>for a day, if it<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> was the latter's second day,<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> and<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> to a woman<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> who counted seven days<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> before<br>she had performed ritual immersion.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> Hence she is at an advantage<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> while her friend is at a<br>disadvantage;<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> so R. Simeon b. Gamaliel. Rabbi ruled, She<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> may not so attribute it.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> Hence both<br>are at a disadvantage. They<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> agree, however, that she may attribute a stain to a woman who was<br>awaiting a day for a day if it<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> was the latter's first day,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> and to a woman who was abiding in her<br>clean blood,<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> and to a virgin whose blood is clean.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> Why was it necessary to state the ‘hence’ of R.<br>Simeon b. Gamaliel?<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> — On account of the ruling of Rabbi.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> Why was it necessary to state the<br>‘hence’ of Rabbi?<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> — It might have been presumed that only the woman on whom the stain was<br>found shall be at a disadvantage while the other shall not be disadvantaged, hence we were informed<br>that both are at a disadvantage.<br>R. Hisda stated: If a clean and an unclean person walked respectively in two paths one of which<br>was clean and the other unclean,<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> we arrive at the dispute between Rabbi and R. Simeon b.<br>Gamaliel.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> R. Adda demurred: Rabbi may have maintained his view only<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> there, because both are<br>in similar conditions,<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> but what difference [to the unclean person in this case] could our assumption<br>make?<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> And R. Hisda?<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> — After all<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> she has yet to perform the immersion.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> It was stated:<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> R.<br>Jose son of R. Hanina ruled, If a clean and an unclean person, and even if a clean, and a doubtfully<br>clean person walked respectively in two paths one of which was unclean and the other clean, it may<br>be assumed, according to the opinion of all,<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> that the unclean path was taken by the doubtfully clean<br>person and the clean path by the clean one.<br>R. Johanan enquired of R. Judah b. Liwai: May a stain<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> be attributed to [another woman<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> who<br>was unclean on account of] a stain? So far as Rabbi's view is concerned the question does not arise;<br>for, since in that case<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> where the woman had observed a discharge from her own body<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> you said<br>[that the other woman's stain] may not be attributed [to her], how much less then may this be done in<br>this case where the stain may have originated from an external cause.<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> The question arises only in<br>connection with the view of R. Simeon b. Gamaliel: Is it only in that case,<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> where the woman had<br>observed a discharge from her own body,<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> that the other woman's stain may be attributed to her, but<br>here, where the stain may have originated from an external cause,<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> she may not so attribute it,<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> or<br>is it possible that no difference is made between the two cases? — The other replied: One may not so<br>attribute it. What is the reason? — Because [there is a tradition that]<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> one may not so attribute it.<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup><br>He pointed out to him the following objection: ‘Is it not permissible to attribute a stain<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> to<br>[another woman<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> who was unclean on account of] a stain. If a woman<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> had lent her shirt to a<br>gentile woman or to one who continued unclean by reason of a stain, she may attribute its to her<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> .<br>(But is not this Baraitha self contradictory: In the first clause you stated, ‘it is not permissible to<br>attribute’ while in the final clause you stated that it was permissible to attribute? — This is no<br>difficulty: The former is the view of Rabbi while the latter is that of R. Simeon b. Gamaliel. There<br>are some who read: The latter as well as the former represents the view of Rabbi, but<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> the latter<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup><br>applies to her first day<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> while the former<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> applies to her second day.<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> R. Ashi replied: The<br>former<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> as well as the latter<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> represents the view of R; Simeon b. Gamaliel and yet there is no<br>difficulty,<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Lit., ‘who sees’.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) A stain found on her shirt.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) And thus remain clean.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Sc. one of mature age.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Who seems to be more restrictive than the first Tanna.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Much less (cf. prev. n.) would the Rabbis (the first Tanna) require that the gentile woman should be one who actually<br>experienced a discharge once before.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) More than the Rabbis. V. p. <sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>, nn. <sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) A stain found on her shirt.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) And since the first Tanna restricts the law he may well uphold also the restriction imposed by Rab.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Against the Baraitha cited by Raba from which it is evident that R. Meir is more lenient than the Rabbis.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Lit., ‘that’, the Baraitha cited by R. Shesheth from which it appears that R. Meir is more restrictive.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) The Baraitha cited by R. Shesheth, according to which the first Tanna ruled that ‘she may attribute it to a gentile<br>woman’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) The gentile woman.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Similarly the Baraitha cited by Raba is to be explained that the first Tanna holds that ‘she may not attribute it to the<br>gentile woman’ unless the latter had experienced a discharge once before, while R. Meir maintains that it may be<br>attributed to her even if she is only capable of a discharge, though she had not experienced one. Both Baraithas thus give<br>the same rulings in different words, and Rab's view is upheld by that of the first Tanna in each.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) Found on her underclothing.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) To whom she had previously lent it.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) The day on which the latter had worn it.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Sc. the day during a zibah period following the one on which she observed a discharge, though on that day none had<br>been observed. This assumption in favour of the former is permitted (despite the slight disadvantage to the latter of<br>having to wait another day) because of the latter's known condition of uncleanness.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) For a similar reason (cf. prev. n. second clause).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) After an established zibah.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Though the latter would in consequence have to count again a new period of seven days.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Lit., ‘repaired’, ‘sound’, sc. she remains clean.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘spoilt’, ‘damaged’; the one having to wait an additional day (cf. supra n. <sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) and the other to count another<br>seven days (cf. prev. n. but one).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Since her attribution would be a disadvantage to her friend.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) Though she herself would in consequence be regarded as unclean.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Rabbi and R. Simeon b. Gamaliel.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) The day on which the latter had worn it.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) When the assumption that the stain was due to her would impose no additional uncleanness upon her.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) From the eighth to the fortieth day after the birth of a male child and from the fifteenth to the eightieth after the birth<br>of a female child. Cf. prev. n.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) Cf. supra <sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>b and prev. n. but one.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Sc. in view of his specific statement that the stain may be attributed to the other woman who was already in a state<br>of uncleanness, is it not obvious that the former is at an advantage while the latter is at a disadvantage?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) According to which both women are at a disadvantage.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) Cf. prev. n. but one mut. mut.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) And it is unknown who walked in which.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) According to the latter, who ruled that a stain found on a clean woman may be attributed by her to a woman who<br>was known to be unclean while she herself remains clean, it may be here assumed that the clean person walked in the<br>clean path and the unclean walked in the unclean one; while according to Rabbi no such assumption could be allowed<br>and both persons must be regarded as unclean.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) Lit., ‘until here Rabbi only said’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) Since even the woman who was hitherto unclean could, by performing immersion, attain cleanness on the day the<br>stain was found. The assumption would consequently place her at an undeserved disadvantage.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) None; since whatever the assumption he is unclean. As the assumption would not place him under any disadvantage<br>Rabbi in this case may well agree with R. Simeon b. Gamaliel.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) How in view of this argument could he maintain his statement?<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) Granted the woman could attain to cleanness by immersion.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) Before doing which she is still unclean in all respects. As Rabbi nevertheless rules out the assumption that the stain<br>was due to her, it is obvious that he would equally rule out the assumption that it was the unclean person who walked in<br>the unclean path.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) In agreement with R. Adda's view that even according to Rabbi it may be assumed that the clean person walked in<br>the clean path and the unclean person in the unclean one.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) Sc. even according to Rabbi.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) Found on the under garment of a woman who was known to be clean.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) Who had previously worn that garment.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) Discussed supra. Lit., ‘there’.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup>) A case of certain uncleanness.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup>) Lit., ‘where it came from the world’; a case of doubtful uncleanness.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup>) And both women are, therefore, unclean.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>) Since the uncleanness that is due to a stain is merely of a doubtful nature, it being possible that the stain originated<br>from an external cause, and the woman cannot in consequence be regarded as prone to a discharge.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup>) And both women are, therefore, unclean.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup>) Found on the under garment of a woman who was known to be clean.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup>) Who had previously worn that garment.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup>) Who discovered the stain.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup>) The stain she discovered.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup>) As to the apparent contradiction.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup>) ‘It is permissible to attribute’.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup>) Sc. the stain was discovered by the woman on the same day on which the other (to whom the garment had been lent)<br>had found a stain on an under garment of hers which caused her to be unclean on that day and also imposed upon her the<br>restriction of remaining unclean until a second day (a day for a day) had passed. Since she has in any case to lose a<br>second day, the attribution does not cause her any disadvantage.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup>) Which does not allow the attribution.<br>(<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup>) When the attribution would place her under a disadvantage by extending her uncleanness to the third day.<br>(<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup>) Which does not allow the attribution.",
        "for the former applies to retrospective uncleanness<sup>1</sup> while the latter applies to future uncleanness.)<sup>2</sup><br>At all events does not a difficulty arise?<sup>3</sup> — Rabina replied: This is no difficulty for it is this that was<br>meant:<sup>4</sup> If she had lent her shirt to a gentile woman,<sup>5</sup> she who discovered<sup>6</sup> the stain<sup>7</sup> may attribute it<br>to her.<sup>8</sup> But was it not stated, ‘or to one who continued unclean by reason of a stain’?<sup>9</sup> — It is this<br>that was meant: Or to one who continued clean owing to clean blood,<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> she who discovered<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> the<br>stain may attribute it to her.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup><br>IF THREE WOMEN HAD WORN etc. FOR R. NEHEMIAH HAS etc. R. Mattenah stated: What<br>is R. Nehemiah's reason? That it is written, And clean<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> she shall sit upon the ground,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> provided she<br>sat on the ground she is clean.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> R. Huna citing R. Hanina stated: R. Nehemiah rules that they are<br>clean if they sat even on the back of an earthenware vessel. But is not this obvious?<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> — It might<br>have been presumed that a restriction shall be imposed on its back as a preventive measure against<br>the possible relaxation of the law in regard to its inside,<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> hence we were informed that on the back<br>of an earthenware vessel they are clean. Abaye stated: R. Nehemiah holds them to be clean if they<br>sat on strips of cloth that were less than three by three fingerbreadths, since such are unsuitable for<br>use either by the poor or the rich.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup><br>R. Hiyya son of R. Mattenah citing Rab stated in his discourse: The halachah is in agreement with<br>R. Nehemiah. Said R. Nahman to him: Abba<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> learnt, ‘A case was once submitted to the Sages and<br>they declared the woman concerned to be unclean’ and you state, ‘the halachah is in agreement with<br>R. Nehemiah’? — What was that case? — The one concerning which it was taught: If two women<br>were grinding with a hand mill and blood was found under the inner one,<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> both are unclean.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> If it<br>was found under the outer one,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> the outer one is unclean<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> but the inner one remains clean.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> If it<br>was found between the two, both are unclean.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> It once happened that blood was found on the edge<br>of a bath,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> and on an olive leaf while they were making a fire in an oven, and when the case was<br>submitted to the Sages they declared them to be unclean.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> This<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> is a point at issue between Tannas.<br>For it was taught: R. Jacob<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> ruled that they were unclean and R. Nehemiah ruled that they were<br>clean, and the Sages<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> ruled in agreement with R. Nehemiah.<br><b>MISHNAH</b>. IF THREE WOMEN SLEPT IN ONE BED AND BLOOD WAS FOUND UNDER<br>ONE OF THEM, THEY ARE ALL UNCLEAN. IF ONE OF THEM EXAMINED HERSELF AND<br>WAS FOUND TO BE UNCLEAN, SHE ALONE IS UNCLEAN WHILE THE TWO OTHERS<br>ARE CLEAN. THEY MAY ALSO ATTRIBUTE THE BLOOD TO ONE ANOTHER.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> AND IF<br>THEY WERE NOT LIKELY<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> TO OBSERVE A DISCHARGE,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> THEY MUST BE REGARDED<br>AS THOUGH THEY WERE LIKELY TO OBSERVE ONE.<br><b>GEMARA</b>. Rab Judah citing Rab explained: But this<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> applies only where she examined herself<br>immediately [after the discovery of the blood],<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> He is of the same opinion as Bar Pada who laid<br>down: Whenever her husband is liable to a sin-offering,<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> her clean things<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> are<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> to be unclean;<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup><br>where her husband is liable to a suspensive guilt-offering,<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> her clean things<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> are regarded as being<br>in a suspended state of uncleanness;<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> and where her husband is exempt,<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> her clean things<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> remain<br>clean. But R. Oshaia<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> ruled: Even where her husband is liable to a sin-offering,<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> her clean things<br>are<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> deemed to be in a suspended state.<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> One can see the reason<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> there, since it might well be<br>assumed that the waiter<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> had caused the obstruction of the blood; but, in this case,<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> if it were a fact<br>that the blood was there,<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> what could have caused its obstruction?<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> R. Jeremiah observed: As to R.<br>Oshaia's metaphor<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> to what may this be compared? To an old man and a child who were walking<br>together on a road. While they are underway the child restrains his gait.<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> but after they enter the<br>town<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> the child accelerates his pace.<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> Abaye on the other hand observed: As to the metaphor of R.<br>Oshaia, to what may this be compared? To a man who puts his finger on his eye. While the finger is<br>on the eye the tears are held back, but as soon as the finger is removed the tears quickly come<br>forth.<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup><br>THEY MAY ALSO ATTRIBUTE THE BLOOD TO ONE ANOTHER. Our Rabbis taught: In<br>what manner do they attribute it to one another? If one was a pregnant woman<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> and the other was<br>not pregnant, the former may attribute the blood to the latter. If one was a nursing woman<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> and the<br>other was not a nursing woman, the former may attribute the blood to the latter. If one was an old<br>woman<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> and the other was not an old woman, the former may attribute the blood to the latter. If one<br>was a virgin<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> and the other was no virgin, the former may attribute the blood to the latter. If both<br>were pregnant, nursing, old or virgins — it is [a case like] this concerning which we have learnt, IF<br>THEY WERE NOT LIKELY TO OBSERVE A DISCHARGE, THEY MUST BE REGARDED<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Sc. to a case where the owner of the shirt discovered the stain on it before the other to whom she had lent it had<br>discovered the stain on her own under garment, Though the other subsequently discovered the stain, she cannot be<br>regarded as unclean retrospectively (from the time the owner of the shirt had discovered the stain) since at that time she<br>was still in a condition of cleanness (cf. Tosaf. and Tosaf. Asheri, contra Rashi).<br>(<sup>2</sup>) The stain on the lent shirt having been discovered after the woman who borrowed it had discovered hers (cf. prev.<br>n.).<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Apparently it does; for since, according to the Baraitha cited, R. Simeon b. Gamaliel allows the attribution how could<br>R. Judah b. Liwai maintain that he does not.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) By the Baraitha under discussion.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Who experienced a discharge.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Lit., ‘the owner of’.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Sc. the Israelitish woman.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) The gentile, who loses thereby nothing, while the Israelitish woman remains clean.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Of course it was. Now if the reference is to the woman who just discovered the stain, how could the expression<br>‘continued’ (which implies that the counting of the clean days had already begun) be used?<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) I.e., either to a gentile woman who is free from the restrictions of uncleanness or to an Israelitish woman who for<br>the reason stated is exempt from uncleanness.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Lit., ‘the owner of’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Since neither would thereby be adversely affected while she remains clean in consequence.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) E.V., utterly bereft.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Isa. III, <sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) I.e., a stain found on the ground does not render her unclean.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Apparently it is, since like a stone bench, the back of an earthenware vessel is not susceptible to uncleanness.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Which is susceptible to uncleanness, and a stain on which would in accordance with Rabbinic law subject a woman<br>to uncleanness.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) And hence unsusceptible to uncleanness.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Abba Arika or Rab. ‘My father’ (Golds.), MS.M., ‘ana’ (‘I’).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) The one nearer to the mill.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Since the other who sits behind her would naturally shift her position towards the mill and, assuming sometimes the<br>same position as the inner one, would be as likely as she to be the cause of the stain in that spot. As it is thus uncertain<br>which of the two was the cause both must be regarded as unclean.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) A position which the inner one would never occupy, the tendency being to come up as close as possible to the mill.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) Since she may have been the cause of the stain.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Cf. prev. n. but one.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) Because either might have been the cause.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Which two women were using.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) Now an olive leaf is not susceptible to uncleanness and yet the Sages (the majority) ruled that a stain on it causes<br>uncleanness. How then could it be said that the halachah agrees with R. Nehemiah who was only an individual?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) Whether R.

SHE ALONE IS UNCLEAN WHILE THE TWO OTHERS<br>ARE CLEAN.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) If, however, her examination had been delayed the others too are unclean.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) In the case, for instance, where she discovered menstrual blood immediately after their intercourse, when it is<br>assumed that the discharge had occurred during intercourse.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) Terumah, for instance, which may be eaten only when clean.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) If she discovered menstrual blood immediately after her contact with them.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) It being assumed (cf. prev. n. but two) that the discharge occurred while she was still handling the clean things. In<br>such a case the uncleanness is regarded as certain and the things she handled must be burnt.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) This is the case where she discovered the blood after an interval had elapsed during which she could descend from<br>the bed and wash her genitals it being doubtful whether the discharge had occurred during or after intercourse.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) If she discovered the blood after such an interval (cf. prev. n.) had passed since she handled them.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) Sc. they may be neither eaten nor burnt.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) In the case where the longer interval (cf. prev. n. but two) had passed before the blood was discovered, when it is<br>regarded as certain hat the discharge occurred after intercourse.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) If a similar interval (cf. prev. n.) had elapsed between the time she has handled them and the discovery of the blood.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) Maintaining that even if a discovery of blood was made immediately after she handled the clean things one cannot<br>be sure that the discharge had occurred earlier when she was still handling them.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) V. supra n. <sup>2</sup>.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) On account of the doubt.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup>) Thus it follows that our Mishnah which ruled that only the woman who found herself on examination to be unclean<br>is regarded as the cause of the blood while the two others remain clean, upholds the opinion of Bar Pada who, where the<br>examination took place immediately after the clean things had been handled, regards the things as definitely unclean. It<br>must be contrary to the view of R. Oshaia who, even in such a case (an examination after the shortest interval), regards<br>the clean things as being merely in a suspected state.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup>) Why it may be assumed that the discharge occurred earlier during intercourse.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup>) Euphemism.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>) The handling of clean things.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup>) Sc. that the discharge occurred earlier.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup>) Obviously nothing. Hence it is only in the case of intercourse (where the assumption is possible) that the husband<br>becomes liable for a sin-offering, but in the case of clean things (where no such assumption is possible) no certain<br>uncleanness may be presumed and only that of a doubtful nature may be imposed upon them Rabbinically for<br>twenty-four hours retrospectively.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup>) ‘The waiter had caused the obstruction of the blood’.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup>) Lit., ‘delays to come’, waiting for the lead of the old man.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup>) When they walk in different directions to their own respective homes.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup>) Lit., ‘hastens to come’.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup>) Who usually loses her menstrual flow.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup>) Sc. a young woman (whether unmarried or married) who had not yet experienced any menstrual discharge (cf. supra<br><sup>8</sup>b).",

Meir stated, It once happened that a sycamore tree at Kefar Saba, held to be in a<br>presumptive state of uncleanness, was examined and no object of uncleanness was found. After a<br>time the wind blew upon it and uprooted it when the skull of a corpse was found stuck in its root.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup><br>They<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> answered him: ‘Do you adduce proof from there?

Jose stated, It once happened that a cave at Shihin, held to be in a presumptive<br>state of uncleanness, was examined until ground, that was as smooth as a finger nail<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> was reached,<br>but no unclean object was found. After a time labourers entered it to shelter from<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> rain, and<br>chopping with their axes found a mortar full of bones.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> They<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> answered him: ‘Do you adduce proof<br>from there? It might be suggested that the examination was not thorough enough’.<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup><br>It was taught: Abba Saul stated, It once happened that a clod at Beth Horon was held in a<br>presumptive state of uncleanness, and the Sages could not properly examine it because its area was<br>extensive.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> But there was an old man in the place<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> whose name was R.

And, having examined the latter, they found a large pit full of bones. One taught: That was the<br>pit which Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had filled with slain bodies, as it is written, Now the pit<br>wherein Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain by the hand<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> of Gedaliah.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup><br>But was it Gedaliah that killed them?

There were certain Galileans about whom a rumour was spread that they killed a person. They<br>came to R.

R. Johanan citing R. Simeon b.

Here too, dye does not have the same effect on<br>wool and flax and, since no [difference could be] discerned,<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> it may well be assumed [that the<br>compromising threads] had dropped out.<br>R. Aha son of R. Yeba citing Mar Zutra ruled: If a man inserted flaxen threads in his woollen<br>garment and then pulled them out but is not sure whether he pulled them [all] out or not, it is quite<br>proper [for him to wear the garment]. What is the reason? — Pentateuchally, since it is written<br>sha'atnez<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> the prohibition does not apply unless the material was hackled, spun and woven,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> but it<br>is only the Rabbis who imposed a prohibition on it,<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> and since the man is not quite sure about the<br>pulling out of the threads the garment is permitted. R. Ashi demurred: Might it not be suggested that<br>it<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> must be either hackled or spun or woven? — The law, however, is in agreement with Mar Zutra,<br>because the All Merciful expressed them in one word.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup><br>Our Rabbis taught: A dyed garment is susceptible to the uncleanness of a bloodstain. R. Nathan b.<br>Joseph ruled: It is not susceptible to the uncleanness of a stain, for dyed garments were ordained for<br>women only in order to relax the law in regard to their bloodstains. ‘Were ordained’! Who<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup><br>ordained them? — Rather read: For dyed garments were permitted to women only in order to relax<br>the law in regard to their bloodstains. ‘Were permitted’! Does this then imply that they were once<br>forbidden? — Yes, for we have learnt: At the time of the Vespasian invasion they<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> prohibited the<br>wearing of garlands by bridegrooms and the beating of drums at weddings. They also desired to<br>prohibit dyed garments, but felt that it was better not to do so,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> in order to relax the law in regard to<br>their bloodstains.<br><b>MISHNAH</b>.

        "Said R. Abba to R. Ashi: Does then the uncleanness<sup>1</sup> depend on whether one is particular? — Yes,<br>the other replied, for it was taught, ‘R. Hiyya ruled: To that which is certain menstrual blood one<br>may apply the seven substances and<sup>2</sup> thereby<sup>3</sup> neutralize it’.<sup>4</sup> But why should this be so,<sup>5</sup> seeing that<br>it is menstrual blood? It is obvious then<sup>6</sup> that uncleanness<sup>1</sup> depends<sup>7</sup> on whether one is particular.<br>Here also<sup>8</sup> then uncleanness<sup>1</sup> may depend on whether one is particular.<br>Elsewhere we learnt: If potsherds which a zab has used<sup>9</sup> absorbed liquids and then fell into the<br>air-space of an oven,<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> and the oven<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> was heated, the oven becomes unclean, because the liquid<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup><br>would<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> ultimately emerge.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> Resh Lakish stated: This<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> was learnt only in regard to liquids of a<br>minor uncleanness<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> but in the case of liquids of a major uncleanness<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> the oven becomes unclean<br>even though it was not heated.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> R. Johanan stated: Whether the liquids were subject to a minor or a<br>major uncleanness the oven is unclean only if it was heated but not otherwise.<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup><br>R. Johanan raised an objection against Resh Lakish: IF ONE IMMERSED IT AND, HAVING<br>HANDLED CLEAN THINGS ON IT, APPLIED TO IT THE SEVEN SUBSTANCES AND THE<br>STAIN DID NOT FADE AWAY, IT MUST BE A DYE; AND THE CLEAN THINGS REMAIN<br>CLEAN AND THERE IS NO NEED TO IMMERSE IT AGAIN.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> The other replied: Leave alone<br>the laws of stains<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> which are merely Rabbinical.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> But [R. Johanan objected] did not R. Hiyya<br>teach, ‘To that which is certain menstrual blood one may apply the seven substances and thereby<br>neutralize it’?<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> — The other replied: If Rabbi<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> has not taught<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> it,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> whence could R. Hiyya<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> know<br>it?<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup><br>R. Johanan pointed out another objection against Resh Lakish: ‘If a quarter of a log of blood<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> was<br>absorbed in the floor of a house [all<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> that is in] the house becomes unclean,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> but others say: [All<br>that is in] the house remains clean. These two versions, however, do not essentially differ, since the<br>former refers to vessels that were there originally<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> while the latter refers to vessels that were<br>brought in subsequently.<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> Where ‘blood was absorbed in a garment, and on being washed, a quarter<br>of a log of blood would emerge from it, it is unclean, but otherwise it is clean!<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> — R. Kahana<br>replied: Here they have learnt some of the more lenient rulings concerning quarters of a log [both<br>referring to a mixture of clean and unclean blood]; [and the law of] mixed blood<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> is different<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> since<br>it<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> is only Rabbinical.<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> Resh Lakish raised an objection against R. Johanan: Any absorbed<br>uncleanness that cannot emerge is regarded as clean.<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> Thus it follows, does it not, that if it can<br>emerge it is unclean even though it had not yet emerged?<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> — R. Papa replied: Wherever it<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> cannot<br>emerge<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> and the owner did not mind absorption,<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> all agree that it is regarded as clean. If it can<br>emerge and the owner does mind the absorption, all agree that it is unclean. They only differ where it<br>can emerge but the owner does not mind its absorption. One Master<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> holds the view that since it can<br>emerge [it is unclean], though the owner did not mind its absorption;<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> and the other Master<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> holds<br>that although it can emerge<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Lit., ‘thing’.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Though the stain is still slightly visible.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Since the application of the substances destroys its natural and original appearance.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Since no one minds such a faint stain it becomes clean.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Cf. prev. n.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) From the fact that it is regarded as clean.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) In this case of R. Hiyya.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) The case supra <sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup>a ad fin.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) And thus rendered unclean.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Without touching the oven itself.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Which was an earthen vessel, that contracts uncleanness through its air-space.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Which has contracted uncleanness from the unclean potsherd into which it was absorbed.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) Owing to the heat of the oven which warms up the potsherds.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Into the air-space and thus convey uncleanness to the oven. Cf. Kel. IX, <sup>5</sup>, where this Mishnah occurs with some<br>variations.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) That uncleanness is conveyed to the oven only where it was heated, but if it was not heated the absorbed liquids<br>convey no uncleanness to it.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Sc. that are not ‘father of uncleanness’ as for instance, a zab's tears. Since the uncleanness that such liquids convey<br>to a vessel is only Rabbinical the oven remains clean when the liquids are in an absorbed state.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Which convey uncleanness to a vessel even according to Pentateuchal law.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) And no liquid has emerged. Since heat causes it to emerge the liquid cannot be regarded as an absorbed<br>uncleanness.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Lit., ‘if the oven was heated yes; if not, not’, since an absorbed uncleanness (cf. Hul. <sup>7</sup><sup>1</sup>a) conveys no uncleanness.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Now if it be granted (with R. Johanan) that an absorbed uncleanness, though it emerges under certain special<br>conditions, is treated as clean, the assumption here that the stain was one of dye and, therefore, clean is well justified; for<br>even though it was blood it would (being absorbed) convey no uncleanness. But if it is maintained (with Resh Lakish)<br>that even an absorbed uncleanness, wherever it would emerge under certain conditions, conveys uncleanness, how could<br>the law be relaxed in this case where the possibility of blood cannot be ruled out?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) With which our Mishnah deals.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) And may be relaxed. Pentateuchally no uncleanness is involved unless blood was found on the woman's body.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) Supra q.v. notes. This shows that even actual blood, if it is in an absorbed state, though it would emerge under an<br>application of soap, is regarded as clean. How then could Resh Lakish maintain that where the oven was not heated,<br>uncleanness is conveyed by the absorbed liquids?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) The compiler of the Mishnah.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) In his authoritative compilation.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) R. Hiyya's ruling.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) Who was the disciple of Rabbi.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) It is obvious that he could not. The Baraitha cited must, therefore, be treated as spurious.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) Of a corpse.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) That is susceptible to uncleanness.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Because the blood of a corpse of the quantity prescribed conveys uncleanness by overshadowing as the corpse<br>itself.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) Before the blood was absorbed, and thus contracted uncleanness by overshadowing.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) After the blood had been absorbed, when it conveys uncleanness no longer.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) Oh. III, <sup>2</sup>; though a full quarter of a log of blood is absorbed in it. Those two rulings prove that an absorbed<br>uncleanness, though it would emerge under special conditions, is regarded as clean. An objection against Resh Lakish.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) Dam tebusah (defined infra <sup>7</sup><sup>1</sup>a) whose uncleanness is doubtful.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) From blood that is definitely unclean.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) Even in an unabsorbed condition.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) Hence ‘the relaxation of the law when it is absorbed.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) Oh. III, <sup>2</sup>.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) How then could R. Johanan maintain in the case of the potsherd that the oven is unclean only when the liquids<br>emerged?<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) The unclean substance.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) From the object that absorbed it.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) MS.M., Maharsha, and some old edd. omit the last eight words.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) Resh Lakish.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) Hence his ruling in the case of the potsherd where the liquid would emerge if the oven were heated.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) R. Johanan.",
        "it is unclean only if the owner minds the absorption, but not otherwise.<sup>1</sup><br>WHAT IS MEANT BY ‘TASTELESS SPITTLE’. One taught:<sup>2</sup> That of a man who tasted nothing<br>since the previous evening. R. Papa intended to explain before Raba [that this bears the same<br>meaning] as when one says that he had tasted nothing in the evening.<sup>3</sup> But Raba<sup>4</sup> pointed out to him:<br>Does it say ‘in the evening’?<sup>3</sup> It only says, ‘Since the previous evening’,<sup>5</sup> thus excluding only the<br>case of one who got up early<sup>6</sup> and ate.<sup>7</sup> Rabbah b. Bar Hana citing R. Johanan stated: What is meant<br>by tasteless spittle? [That of a person] who spent half a night in sleep.<sup>8</sup> This then implies that the<br>quality of spittle<sup>9</sup> depends on sleep. But have we not learnt:<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> If a man slept all day his is no tasteless<br>spittle and if he was awake all night it is tasteless spittle?<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> — There<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> it is a case, where one was in<br>a state of drowsiness.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> What state of drowsiness is hereby to be understood? — R. Ashi replied:<br>Where a man is half asleep and half awake;<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> when addressed he answers but is unable to give any<br>rational reply, and when he is reminded of any thing he can recall it.<br>One taught: If a man rose up early in the morning and studied his lesson, his is no tasteless<br>spittle.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> But for how long?<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> — R. Judah b. Shila citing R. Ashi who had it from R. Eleazar replied:<br>For a period during ‘which<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> can be uttered the greater part of one's usual talk in the course of three<br>hours.<br>THE LIQUID OF CRUSHED BEANS? — PASTE MADE OF CRUSHED BEANS etc. May it be<br>suggested that this<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> provides support for Resh Lakish; for Resh Lakish said: There must be tasteless<br>spittle with each of the substances? — It is possible that the heat of one's mouth suffices.<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> Our<br><b>MISHNAH</b><sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> is not in agreement with R.

Judah explained,<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> Boiling liquid<br>of crushed beans before [‘ober] salt is put into it.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> What is the proof that the expression<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> ‘ober’<br>means ‘before’? — R. Nahman b. Isaac replied: Since Scripture says, Then Ahimaaz ran by way of<br>the plain, and overran [wa-ya'abor]<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> the Cushite.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> Abaye replied, The proof comes from here: And<br>he himself passed over [‘abar]<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> before them.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> And if you prefer I might reply that the proof comes<br>from here: And their king is passed on [wa-ya'abor]<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> before them, and the Lord before them.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup><br>URINE? THIS REFERS TO SUCH AS HAS FERMENTED. One taught: What must be the<br>duration of<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> their fermentation? Three days. R. Johanan observed, All the standards of the Sages in<br>respect of bloodstains need additional standards to define them:<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> [Is the urine that] of a child or of<br>an old man,<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> of a man or of a woman,<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> covered<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> or uncovered, of the summer season<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> or of the<br>winter season?<br>ONE MUST SCOUR THE STAIN THREE TIMES. R. Jeremiah enquired: Does the forward and<br>backward movement<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> count as one or is it possible that it counts as two? Now what is the decision?<br>— This stands undecided.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup><br>IF THEY WERE NOT APPLIED IN THE PRESCRIBED ORDER. Our Rabbis taught: If the<br>latter<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> were applied before the former,<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> one Baraitha teaches, ‘The latter<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> are counted<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> and the<br>former<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> are not counted,’<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> while another [Baraitha] teaches, ‘The former are counted and the latter<br>are not counted’!<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> — Abaye replied: According to both statements the latter<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> are counted, and the<br>former<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> are not; but ‘former’<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> refers to those that are<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> first in the prescribed order<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> though second<br>in the process of application.<br><b>MISHNAH</b>.

R. Huna b. Hiyya citing<br>Samuel observed: Behold [the Sages] have ruled that ‘for settled periods [that are determined by the<br>number] of days two [occurrences are required],<sup>4</sup> for settled periods [that are determined by the<br>condition] of the body one occurrence suffices,<sup>5</sup> for settled periods [that are determined by<br>conditions] which the Sages did not enumerate three occurrences are required;<sup>6</sup> But [I do not know]<br>what the expression, ‘for settled periods that are determined by conditions which the Sages did not<br>enumerate intended to include? — R. Joseph replied: To include a woman who feels a heaviness in<br>the head,<sup>3</sup> a heaviness in her limbs, who shivers or belches. Said Abaye to him:<sup>7</sup> What does he teach<br>us thereby,<sup>8</sup> seeing that this is actually a ruling in our Mishnah,<sup>9</sup> Rabbah b. ‘Ulla having thus<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup><br>explained it? — Rather, said Abaye, it<sup>8</sup> was intended to include one who ate garlic and observed a<br>discharge, one who ate onions and observed a discharge, and one who chewed pepper and observed a<br>discharge. R. Joseph observed: I have not heard this tradition.<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> Said Abaye to him: You yourself<br>have told it to us, and it was in connection with the following that you told it to us:<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> If a woman was<br>in the habit of observing a discharge on the fifteenth day of the month and this was changed to the<br>twentieth day, intercourse is forbidden to her on both days.<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> If she observed a discharge on three<br>consecutive months<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> on the twentieth day, intercourse on the fifteenth becomes permitted<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> and she<br>establishes the twentieth day as her settled period: for no woman can establish for herself a settled<br>period unless the discharge had appeared three times on the same date.<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> And in connection with this<br>you told us: Rab Judah citing Samuel stated, This is the view of R. Gamaliel son of Rabbi who cited<br>it in the name of R. Simeon b. Gamaliel,<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> but the Sages ruled: If she observed a discharge once<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup><br>she need not<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> repeat it a second time and a third time. And when we asked you, ‘Since you said,<br>\"She need not repeat it a second time\" was there any need to state that she need not repeat it a third<br>time’? you replied’ She need not repeat it a second time in the case of settled periods [that are<br>determined by the condition] of her body and she need not repeat it a third time in the case of settled<br>periods [determined by the number] of days. But why did he not simply say, ‘This is the view of R.<br>Simeon b. Gamaliel’?<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> — It is this that Samuel informed us: That R.

If a woman had the habit of observing her discharge on the twentieth day of the<br>month<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> and at the sixth hour of the day,<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> and the twentieth day arrived and she observed no<br>discharge, she is forbidden intercourse during all the first six hours;<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> so R. Judah. R. Jose, however,<br>permits it until the beginning of the sixth hour<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> but during the sixth hour she must take into<br>consideration [the possibility of a discharge].<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> If the sixth hour has passed and she observed no<br>discharge, she is still forbidden intercourse all that day; so R. Judah, R. Jose, however, permits it<br>from the time of the afternoon service<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> onwards.<br>IF SHE HAD THE HABIT [etc.]. But was it not taught: R. Judah ruled, She<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> is permitted<br>intercourse all night?<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> — This is no contradiction. The Baraitha deals with the case of<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> one who<br>had the habit of observing the discharge at the beginning of the day<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> while the Mishnah deals with<br>one who had the habit of observing the discharge at the end of the night.<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup><br>One [Baraitha] taught: R.

This,<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> however, represents no difficulty, since the former is a case where she<br>usually observes her discharge at the end of the night while the latter is a case where she usually<br>observes it at the beginning of the day.<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup><br>Raba stated: The halachah is in agreement with R.

But could Raba have said this, seeing<br>that it was taught: Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness;<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> from this, R.<br>Jeremiah<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> observed, follows a warning to the children of Israel that they shall separate from their<br>wives near their periods. And for how long? Raba<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> replied: One ‘onah.<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> Now does not this mean:<br>An additional ‘onah?<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> — No; the same ‘onah. But then, what need is there for the two statements?<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup><br>— Both are required. For, if he had informed us of the former statement only, it might have been<br>presumed that it applied only to the law relating to clean things but not to that relating to a woman's<br>permissibility to her husband. Hence we were informed [of the latter statement].

        "GEMARA. It was stated: If a woman observed a discharge on the fifteenth day of one month, on the<br>sixteenth of the next month and on the seventeenth of the third month, Rab ruled: She has thereby<br>established for herself a settled period in arithmetical progression,<sup>1</sup> but Samuel ruled: No settled<br>period can be established unless the progression is repeated three times.<sup>2</sup> Must it be conceded that<br>Rab and Samuel differ on the same principle as that on which Rabbi and R. Simeon b. Gamaliel<br>differ? For it was taught: If a woman was married to one man who died and to a second one who also<br>died, she may not be married to a third one; so Rabbi. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel ruled: She may be<br>married to a third but may not be married to a fourth?<sup>3</sup> — No, all<sup>4</sup> may concede that the law is in<br>agreement with R. Simeon b. Gamaliel but it is this principle on which they<sup>5</sup> differ here: Rab holds<br>that the fifteenth day is included in the number while Samuel holds that the fifteenth, since the<br>observation on it was not in arithmetic progression, is not included in the number.<sup>6</sup><br>He raised an objection against him: If a woman had been accustomed to observe her discharge on<br>the fifteenth day<sup>7</sup> and this was changed<sup>8</sup> to the sixteenth, intercourse is forbidden<sup>9</sup> on both days.<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> If<br>this was changed<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> to the seventeenth day, intercourse<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> on the sixteenth is again permitted<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> but on<br>the fifteenth<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> and the seventeenth<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> it is forbidden. If<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> this was changed to the eighteenth<br>intercourse<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> is again permitted on all the former dates;<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> and<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> is forbidden only on the day after<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup><br>the eighteenth and onwards.<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> Now does not this<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> present an objection against Rab?<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> — Rab can<br>answer you: Where a woman was accustomed to observe her discharge on a certain date<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> the law is<br>different.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> But as to him who raised the objection, on what possible ground did he raise it?<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> — [He<br>assumed that the case of] one who was accustomed to a settled period had to be stated:<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> As it might<br>have been presumed that since she was accustomed to observe her discharge on a settled date and<br>this was changed, the change is effective<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> even if this<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> occurred only twice, hence we had to be<br>informed [that<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> the change must have recurred three times].<br>An objection was raised: If she observed a discharge on the twenty-first day of one<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> month, on<br>the twenty-second of the next month and on the twenty-third of the third month, she has thereby<br>established for herself a settled period. If she skipped over<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> to the twenty-fourth<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> day of the month,<br>she has not established for herself a settled period.<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> Does not this<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> present an objection against<br>Samuel?<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> — Samuel can answer you: Here we are dealing with the case of a woman, for instance,<br>who was accustomed to observe her discharge on the twentieth day and this<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> was changed to the<br>twenty-first.<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> An inference from the wording also justifies this view;<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> for the twentieth day was left<br>out<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> and the twenty-first was mentioned.<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> This is conclusive.<br>FOR A WOMAN MAY NOT REGARD HER MENSTRUAL PERIOD AS SETTLED UNLESS<br>THE RECURRENCE HAS BEEN REGULAR etc. R. Papa explained: This<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> was said only in<br>regard to the establishment of a settled period,<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> but as regards taking the possibility of a discharge<br>into consideration<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> one occurrence suffices.<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> But what<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> does he<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> teach us, seeing that we have<br>learnt: IF SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO OBSERVE A FLOW OF MENSTRUAL BLOOD ON<br>THE FIFTEENTH DAY AND THIS WAS CHANGED TO THE TWENTIETH DAY, MARITAL<br>INTERCOURSE IS FORBIDDEN ON BOTH DAYS?<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> — If the inference had to be made from<br>there,<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> it might have been presumed that the ruling<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> applied only where the woman was still<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup><br>within her menstruation period,<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> but where she is not within her menstruation period<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> she<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> need<br>not consider the possibility of a discharge,<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> hence we were informed<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> [that even in the latter case<br>the possibility of a discharge must be taken into consideration].<br>NOR IS SHE RELEASED FROM THE RESTRICTIONS OF A SETTLED PERIOD etc. R. Papa<br>explained: This, that it is necessary for the change to recur three times before a settled period can be<br>abolished, was said only where a settled period had been established by three regular occurrences,<br>but one that was established by two recurrences only may be abolished by one change. But what<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup><br>does he<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> teach us, seeing that we learnt: A WOMAN MAY NOT REGARD HER MENSTRUAL<br>PERIODS AS SETTLED UNLESS THE RECURRENCE HAS BEEN REGULAR THREE<br>TIMES?<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> — It might have been presumed<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> that one occurence<sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> is required for the abolition of<br>one,<sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> two<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> for two<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> and three<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> for three,<sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> hence we were informed<sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> [that even for two<br>occurrences<sup>6</sup><sup>4</sup> only ones is required].<sup>6</sup><sup>5</sup> It was taught in agreement with R. Papa:<sup>6</sup><sup>6</sup> If a woman had a<br>habit of observing her menstrual discharge on the twentieth day,<sup>6</sup><sup>7</sup> and this was changed to the<br>thirtieth, intercourse is forbidden<sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup> on both days. If the twentieth day<sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup> arrived and she observed no<br>discharge, she is permitted intercourse until the thirtieth but must consider the possibility of a<br>discharge on the thirtieth day itself.<sup>6</sup><sup>9</sup> If the thirtieth day arrived and she observed a discharge, the<br>twentieth<sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup> arrived and she observed none, the thirtieth arrived and she observed none and the<br>twentieth<sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup> arrived and she observed one, the thirtieth<sup>6</sup><sup>8</sup> becomes a permitted day<sup>7</sup><sup>0</sup><br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Lit., ‘in skipping’. The eighteenth day of the fourth month, the nineteenth of the fifth and so on are consequently<br>forbidden days.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Sc. only if in the intercourse given, the discharge had actually appeared on the eighteenth of the fourth month. The<br>appearance on the fifteenth is not counted since it was the first of the series when the process of progression had not yet<br>been apparent (v. infra).<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Is the case of the husbands, it is asked, analogous to that of the periods, so that Rab's view coincides with that of<br>Rabbi and the view of Samuel with that of R. Simeon b. Gamaliel? But, if so, why should the same principle be<br>discussed twice?<br>(<sup>4</sup>) Even Rab.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Rab and Samuel.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Cf. prev. n. but three.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Of the month.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) In a subsequent month.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) In the month following that in which the discharge appeared on the sixteenth.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) The fifteenth and sixteenth.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) In the month following that in which the discharge appeared on the sixteenth.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) In the month following.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) As a discharge appeared on it once only, the prohibition on it also is abolished by one change.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Which was the day of her established settled period.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) The day on which her discharge was last observed.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) It is permitted on the sixteenth and seventeenth for the reason given supra (prev. n. but two); and on the fifteenth it<br>is permitted because in three consecutive months the discharge appeared on days (sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth)<br>other than the fifteenth which, in consequence, can no longer be regarded as the settled period.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Since the discharge appeared three times on days that represent an arithmetical progression.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Lit., ‘from’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Sc. on the nineteenth of the next month, the twentieth of the one following it, and so on in arithmetical progression<br>in each succeeding month.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) From which it is obvious that, since only three occurrences cause the abolition of the old, and the establishment of a<br>new settled period, the first occurrence is not counted.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Who ruled that even a change on two dates in arithmetical progression abolishes the old, and establishes a new<br>settled period.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) As is the case in the Baraitha cited.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) From that dealt with by Rab. In the former case, the first of the dates under discussion might well be added to the<br>similar dates in the previous months and hence could not be counted as the first in the arithmetical progression. In the<br>case dealt with by Rab, however, either the first of the dates under discussion was one on which the woman observed a<br>discharge for the very first time, or the woman was one who had never before had a settled period or one whose settled<br>period was on a day other than the first of those under discussion. The first day, therefore, may well be counted as one of<br>the three days that establish a settled period.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Sc. did he not know of the difference between a settled and an unsettled period?<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) Though the same law applies to one who had no settled period.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Sc. the first date is no longer regarded as a settled period.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) The change from the date mentioned.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) If a new settled period is to be established.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) Lit., ‘this’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) From the twenty-second.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Instead of the twenty-third.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) Since the difference between the dates of the first and the second month was only one day while that between the<br>second and the third was two days.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) The first case where three observations, including the first one, establish a settled period.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) Who maintains that no settled period in arithmetical progression can be established unless the discharge appeared<br>on three dates exclusive of the first.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) The first discharge mentioned.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) So that the change actually occurred three times (on the twenty-first, twenty-second and twenty-third) on dates in<br>arithmetical progression exclusive of the first date which was the twentieth.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) That we are here dealing with a case where the woman ‘was accustomed to observe her discharge on the twentieth’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) From the three dates given.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) Had not the woman had the habit of observing her discharge on the twentieth, that date (which is simpler than the<br>twenty-first) would have been taken as an example of the first of the three dates, and the twenty-first and twenty-second<br>would have been taken as examples of the subsequent dates.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) That the occurrence must be repeated three times.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) Sc. that the uncleanness should begin just at the time of the period and not earlier; and that the settled period should<br>not be abolished unless a change occurred three times.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) Sc. to treat the date on which a discharge appeared in one month as one on which intercourse is forbidden in the<br>next month.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘in one time she fears’. If, for instance, she observed a discharge on the fifteenth of one month intercourse is<br>forbidden on the same date in the next month.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) That we did not know before.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) R.

Papa.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup>) When the discharge appeared.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>) As is the case in our Mishnah where the discharge occurred on the fifteenth day after immersion, which is the fourth<br>day (<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> days of zibah + <sup>4</sup> days of the <sup>7</sup> of menstruation = <sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) of a menstruation period. Hence the restriction when the<br>next fifteenth day (also within the menstruation period) arrives.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup>) But in the zibah period; where, for instance, her discharge appeared on the tenth day after immersion, which is still<br>within the eleven days of a zibah period that follows that of the seven days of menstruation.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup>) Since the zibah period is one during which a discharge is unusual.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup>) And intercourse should, therefore, be permitted when the next similar date arrives.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup>) By R. Papa.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup>) That we did not know before.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup>) R. Papa.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup>) And since this is followed by NOR IS SHE RELEASED . . . UNLESS IT HAS VARIED THREE TIMES it is<br>obvious that the three occurrences for the abolition of a settled period (the latter case) are necessary only where there<br>were three occurrences for its establishment (the first case). What need then was there for R. Papa's ruling?<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup>) If only our Mishnah were available and not R.

R. Nahman b. Isaac explained:<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> Even if she already observed a discharge.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> Whence<br>is this inferred? — Since in the final clause<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> a distinction is drawn between one who did and one<br>who did not observe a discharge it follows that in the case in the first clause no distinction is made<br>between the one and the other.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> So it was also taught: Beth Hillel ruled: Intercourse is allowed until<br>the wound is healed irrespective of whether she already<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> did or did not observe a discharge.<br>UNTIL THE WOUND IS HEALED. For how long?<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> — Rab Judah replied: Rab said, ‘So long as<br>it discharges matter’, but when I mentioned this in the presence of Samuel the latter said to me, ‘I do<br>not know what that \"discharging\" exactly means; rather explain.<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> So long as spittle is engendered in<br>the mouth<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> on account of intercourse’.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> How is one to understand the ‘discharging’ of which Rab<br>spoke? — R. Samuel son of R. Isaac replied. This was explained to me by Rab: If when standing she<br>observes a discharge and when sitting she does not observe one, it may be known that the wound has<br>not healed; if when lying on the ground she observes a discharge and when lying on cushions and<br>bolsters she does not observe one, it may be known that the wound had not healed; and if when lying<br>on any of these she either observes a discharge or does not observe one, it may be known that the<br>wound is healed.<br>IF THE AGE OF HER MENSTRUATION HAS ARRIVED etc. It was stated: If she had<br>intercourse in the day time,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> Rab ruled, She has not lost thereby the right to intercourse during the<br>nights. but Levi ruled, She has thereby lost the right to intercourse in the nights. Rab ruled, ‘She has<br>not lost thereby the right to intercourse during the nights’, because we learnt, UNTIL THE EXIT OF<br>THE SABBATH.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> ‘But Levi ruled, She has thereby lost the right to intercourse in the nights’, for<br>the meaning of<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> FOUR NIGHTS mentioned is four ‘onahs.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> But according to Rab<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> what was the<br>purpose of mentioning FOUR NIGHTS? — We were thereby informed of what is regarded as good<br>manners, viz., that intercourse should take place at night.<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> But according to Levi<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> it should only<br>have been stated FOUR NIGHTS, what was the purpose of saying, UNTIL THE EXIT OF THE<br>SABBATH? — It is this that we were informed:<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> That it is permitted to perform the first marital<br>intercourse<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> on the Sabbath,<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> in agreement with a ruling of Samuel; for Samuel ruled: It is<br>permissible to enter through a narrow breach<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> on the Sabbath although one causes pebbles to fall.<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup><br>It was stated: If a man had marital intercourse<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> and found no blood but, having repeated the act,<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup><br>he found blood, R. Hanina ruled: The woman is unclean;<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> but R. Assi ruled: She is clean. ‘R.<br>Hanina ruled: The woman is unclean’, for if it were the case that the blood was that of virginity it<br>would have issued on the first occasion. ‘But R. Assi ruled: She is clean’, because it is possible that<br>something unusual may have happened to her, in accordance with a statement of Samuel; for Samuel<br>stated, ‘I could perform a number of acts of intercourse without causing any bleeding’. And the<br>other?<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> — Samuel is different from ordinary people since his capability<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> was great.<br>Rab stated: A woman who has reached her maturity<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> is<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> allowed<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> all the first night.<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> But this<br>applies only to a woman who had never yet observed a discharge, but if she did observe one she is<br>permitted the obligatory act of intercourse only and no more. An objection was raised: It once<br>happened that Rabbi allowed a woman intercourse on four nights in twelve months.<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> Now how is<br>one to understand his ruling? If it be suggested that he allowed her all these nights<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> during the<br>period of her minority<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) The established settled period which was changed to the thirtieth no more than twice.

        "the objection would arise: Have we not learnt, UNTIL THE WOUND IS HEALED?<sup>1</sup> If, however, it<br>is suggested that he allowed her all the nights during the period of her na'aruth<sup>2</sup> the difficulty would<br>arise: Does na'aruth ever extend over twelve months, seeing that Samuel had stated: The period<br>intervening between the commencement of na'aruth and maturity is only six months? And should<br>you suggest that the meaning is that the period is not shorter but may be longer<sup>3</sup> it could be retorted:<br>Did he not in fact state ‘only’?<sup>4</sup> If, however, it is suggested that he allowed her two nights during the<br>days of her minority and two during her na'aruth, the difficulty would arise: Did not R. Hinena b.<br>Shelemya once ask Rab, ‘what is the ruling where her age of menstruation arrived when she was<br>already under the authority of her husband?’ and the other replied: All acts of intercourse which one<br>performs<sup>5</sup> are regarded as one act only and the other<sup>6</sup> make up the four nights?<sup>7</sup> Consequently this<br>must be a case where he allowed her one night during her minority, two nights during her na'aruth<br>period and one night during the days of her maturity. Now if you grant that a woman of mature age<br>generally is allowed<sup>8</sup> more than one night<sup>9</sup> one can well see the justification for the ruling;<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> for, as<br>intercourse during minority has the effect of reducing one night<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> during her na'aruth period, so<br>intercourse during the na'aruth period has the effect of reducing one night<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> during her maturity;<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup><br>but if you maintain<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> that a woman of mature age generally<sup>8</sup> is not allowed more than one night,<br>should he<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> not have allowed her<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> but one act of the obligatory marital intercourse and no more?<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup><br>— The fact is that he<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> allowed her one night during her minority and three nights during her<br>na'aruth period,<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> but<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> it was not as you think<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> that every three months represented a period; every<br>two months rather represented a period.<br>Menjamin of Saksanah was embarking on a journey<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> to the locality of Samuel where he intended<br>to act<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> according to the ruling of Rab,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> even where the woman had observed a discharge, assuming<br>that Rab drew no distinction between one who did and one who did not observe a discharge, but he<br>died while he was underway.

For twelve months. R.<br>Simeon b.

(As these provisions were applied to yen nesek so were they applied to matters<br>of cleanness. But is not the order<sup>6</sup> reversed, seeing that we are here dealing with the laws of<br>cleanness? — Rather say: As these provisions were applied to matters of cleanness so were they<br>applied to yen nesek.) And how long is an ‘onah? R. Hiyya b. Abba citing R. Johanan replied: Either<br>a day or a night. R. Hana She'una or, as some say, R. Hana b. She'una citing Rabbah b. Bar Hana<br>who had it from R. Johanan replied: Half a day and half a night. And in connection with this R.<br>Samuel b. R. Isaac explained: There is no real difference between them,<sup>7</sup> the former referring to the<br>spring and autumn equinoxes<sup>8</sup> and the latter to the summer and winter solstices?<sup>9</sup> — Here also, in<br>the case of the menstruant woman,<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> read: Half a day and half a night. But did he not say ‘a night<br>and half a day’? — Rather say: Either ‘a night’ in the spring or autumn equinox or ‘half a day and<br>half a night’ in the winter or summer solstice. And if you prefer I might reply: The case involving a<br>kethubah<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> is different<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> since protracted negotiations take place<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> before it is signed.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup><br>Both Rab and Samuel laid down: The halachah is that<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> one performs the obligatory marital act<br>and withdraws forthwith. R.

Rather raise one from our Mishnah?<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> — But he was of the<br>opinion that a practical decision<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> is weightier.<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> At all events,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> does not a difficulty arise against<br>Rab and Samuel?<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> They acted in agreement with our Masters; for it was taught: Our Masters<br>decided by a second count of votes<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> that one only performs the obligatory marital act and withdraws<br>forthwith.<br>‘Ulla stated: When R. Johanan and Resh Lakish were engaged in the discussions of the chapter on<br>the ‘Young Girl’<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> they carried away from it only what a fox carries away from a ploughed field,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup><br>and concluded it<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> with this statement: One performs the obligatory marital act and withdraws<br>forthwith. Said R. Abba to R. Ashi: Now then,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> should a scrupulous man<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> not even finish his act?<br>— The other replied: If that were to be the rule<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> one would be ill at ease<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> and would withdraw<br>altogether.<br>Our Rabbis taught: But all these women if they<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> were continually discharging blood during<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> the<br>four nights and after the four nights or<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> during the night and after it, must without exception<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup><br>examine themselves;<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> and in the case of all these R.

Meir ruled: The colours of the various kinds of blood are different from one<br>another. In what manner? Menstrual blood is red, the blood of virginity is not so red; menstrual<br>blood is turbid, the blood of virginity is not turbid; menstrual blood issues from the source, the blood<br>of virginity issues from the sides. R. Isaac son of R. Jose citing R. Johanan stated: This is the ruling<br>of R.

If<br>blood is found on the top of the absorbent it may be known that it<sup>2</sup> emanated from the source<sup>3</sup> and if<br>no blood is found on the top, it may be known that it<sup>2</sup> emanated from the sides.<sup>4</sup> If, however, she has<br>a wound in that place she may attribute the blood to her wound.<sup>4</sup> If she has a fixed period<sup>5</sup> she may<br>attribute it to her fixed period,<sup>6</sup> but if the nature of the blood of her wound is different from that of<br>the blood of her observation she may not so attribute it. A woman, furthermore, is believed when she<br>says, ‘I have a wound in the source from which blood is discharged’;<sup>4</sup> so Rabbi.<sup>7</sup> R. Simeon b.<br>Gamaliel ruled: The blood of a wound that is discharged through the source is unclean. Our Masters,<br>however, testified that the blood of a wound that is discharged through the source is clean. What is<br>the point at issue between them?<sup>8</sup> — ‘Ulla replied: The point at issue between them is the question<br>whether the interior of the uterus is unclean.<sup>9</sup> Would not a tube<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> bruise her?<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> — Samuel replied:<br>The examination is performed with a leaden tube whose edge<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> is bent inwards. But, said Resh<br>Lakish to R. Johanan, why should she not<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> examine herself<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> after the third intercourse with her<br>first husband?<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> — The other replied: Because not all fingers<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> are alike.<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> But, the former said, why<br>should she not<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> have to examine herself<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> after the first intercourse with her third husband? —<br>Because not all ejections<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> are of equal force.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup><br>A certain woman once came to Rabbi [with such a complaint].<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> Go, he said to Abdan, and<br>frighten her. As the latter approached and frightened her a clot of blood dropped from her. This<br>woman, Rabbi exclaimed, is now cured. A certain woman [with a similar complaint]<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> once came to<br>the Master Samuel. Go, he said to R. Dimi b. Joseph, and frighten her. The latter approached and<br>frightened her but nothing dropped from her. This woman, Samuel pronounced, is one full of blood<br>which she scatters,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> and any woman who is full of blood which she scatters<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> has no cure. Once<br>there came to R. Johanan a certain woman who, whenever she emerged from her ritual immersion,<br>observed a discharge of blood. It is possible, he said to her, that the gossip of your townspeople<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> has<br>caused the affliction;<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> arrange<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> for your intercourse with him to take place near the river side.<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup><br>There is one who says: He<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> said to her, Reveal your affliction to your friends so that, as they were<br>astounded in one way,<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> they may also be astounded in the other.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> There is also one who says: He<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup><br>said to her, Announce your trouble to your friends so that they may offer prayers for mercy to be<br>vouchsafed to you. For it was taught: And shall cry, ‘Unclean, unclean’,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> he must announce his<br>trouble to the public so that they may pray for mercy to be vouchsafed to him. R. Joseph stated: Such<br>an incident once occurred at Pumbeditha and the woman was cured.<br>R. Joseph citing Rab Judah who had it from Rab stated: Rabbi ordained at Sadoth,<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> If a woman<br>observed a discharge on one day she<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> must wait<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> six days in addition to it.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> If she observed<br>discharges on two days she<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> must wait<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> six days in addition to these.<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> If she observed a discharge<br>on three days she<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> must wait<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> seven clean days.<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> R. Zera stated: The daughters of Israel have<br>imposed upon themselves the restriction that even if they observe a drop of blood of the size of a<br>mustard seed they wait on account of it seven clean days.<br>Raba took R. Samuel out for a walk<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> when he discoursed as follows: If a woman<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> was in<br>protracted labour<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> for two days and on the third she miscarried she must wait seven clean days; he<br>being of the opinion that the law relating to protracted labour<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> does not apply to miscarriages and<br>that it is impossible for the uterus<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> to open without bleeding. Said R. Papa to Raba: What is the<br>point in speaking of one who was in protracted labour for two days seeing that the same applies even<br>where there was the minutest discharge, since R. Zera stated, The daughters of Israel have imposed<br>upon themselves the restriction that even where they observe only a drop of blood of the size of a<br>mustard seed they wait on account of it seven clean days? — The other replied: I am speaking to you<br>of a prohibition,<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> and you talk of a custom which applies only where the restriction has been<br>adopted.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup><br>(Mnemonic. Had an offer, natron, In warm water, to perform immersion, folds upon a haven.)<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup><br>Raba stated: If a woman had an offer of marriage and she accepted it she<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> must allow seven clean<br>days to pass.<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup><br>Rabina was engaged in preparations for the marriage of his son at R. Hanina's.<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> ‘Does the<br>Master’, the latter said to him, ‘intend writing the kethubah four days hence?’ ‘Yes’, the other<br>replied; but when the fourth day arrived he waited for another four days and thus caused a delay of<br>seven days after the day in question.<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> ‘Why’, the first asked, ‘all this delay?’<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> ‘Does not the<br>Master’, the other replied, ‘hold the opinion of Raba, Raba having ruled: If a woman had an offer of<br>marriage and she accepted she must allow seven clean days to pass?’ ‘It is possible’, the first<br>suggested, that Raba spoke only of one of mature age who is likely to discharge menstrual blood,<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup><br>but did he speak of a minor who is unlikely to discharge menstrual blood?’ ‘Raba’, the other replied,<br>‘has explicitly stated: There is no difference between one of mature age and a minor.

        "three hairs<sup>1</sup> constitute no interposition;<sup>2</sup> but I do not know the ruling in the case of two’. R. Johanan,<br>however, stated, ‘We have only this one principle: R. Isaac said, According to traditional law<sup>3</sup> an<br>interposition on its<sup>4</sup> major part<sup>5</sup> to which a man objects constitutes an interposition but one which he<br>does not mind constitutes no interposition; but the Rabbis ruled that an interposition on its<sup>4</sup> greater<br>part shall constitute an interposition, even when the man does not mind it, as a preventive measure<br>against the possibility of allowing an interposition on its major part to which the man does object;<br>and they also ruled that an interposition on its minor part to which a man objects shall constitute an<br>interposition as a preventive measure against the possibility of allowing an interposition on its major<br>part to which a man objects.<sup>6</sup> But why should no prohibition be enacted also against an interposition<br>on its lesser part, to which one does not object, as a preventive measure against the possibility of<br>allowing an interposition over the lesser part to which one does object?<sup>7</sup> — This ruling itself<sup>8</sup> is but<br>a preventive measure, shall we go so far<sup>9</sup> as to institute a preventive measure against the possibility<br>of infringing a preventive measure?<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup><br>Rab ruled: If a menstruant performs immersion at ‘the proper time<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> she may do it only at night<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup><br>but if she performs it after the proper time<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> she may do it either in the day time or at night.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> R.<br>Johanan ruled: Whether at the proper time or after the proper time a menstruant may perform<br>immersion only at night, on account of the possibility of her daughter's following her lead.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> Rab,<br>moreover, also withdrew his ruling; for R. Hiyya b.

Simeon stated: After that she shall be clean<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup><br>implies that after the act<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> she shall<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> be clean, but the Sages have ruled that it was forbidden to do<br>so in case she might thereby land in a doubtful situation.<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup><br>R.

A<br>woman may wash her head on a Sunday and undergo immersion on the following Thursday, since<br>similarly she may wash her head on a Friday and undergo immersion in the night following the two<br>festival days of the New Year that happened to fall immediately after a Saturday. R. Hisda, however,<br>stated: In all these cases<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> we rule as mentioned<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> but we do not draw the inference of ‘since<br>similarly’; for where [the avoidance of an interval] is possible an interval must be avoided,<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> and<br>only where this is impossible<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> may an interval be allowed.<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> R. Yemar, however, stated: We may<br>even draw the inferences of ‘since similarly’<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> except in the case where a woman is permitted to<br>wash her head on a Sunday and undergo immersion on the following Thursday, for the parallel of the<br>night following the two festival days of the New Year that happened to fall immediately after a<br>Saturday does not hold, since it is possible for the woman to wash her head and undergo immersion<br>in the same night.<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> Meremar in his discourse laid down: The law is in agreement with R.

And, furthermore, is it not surprising to yourself that a<br>woman should be allowed to<sup>6</sup> wash her head in the day time and perform immersion at night seeing<br>that it is required that immersion should follow immediately after the washing of the head, which is<br>not the case here? Raba subsequently appointed an amora<sup>7</sup> in connection with this matter and<br>delivered the following discourse: The statement I made to you is an erroneous one,<sup>8</sup> but in fact it<br>was this that was reported in the name of R. Johanan, ‘A woman may not wash her head on the<br>Sabbath eve and perform immersion at the termination of the Sabbath’; and, furthermore, it would be<br>surprising that a woman should be allowed to<sup>6</sup> wash her head in the day time and perform immersion<br>at night seeing that it is required that immersion should closely follow the washing of the head,<br>which would not be the case here. But the law is that a woman may wash her head in the day time<br>and perform immersion at night.

Is there any authority who holds such a view?<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> — Yes; and so it<br>was taught: Rabbi stated, ‘I once asked R. Jose and R. Simeon when they were underway: What is<br>the law where a menstruant examined herself on the seventh day in the morning and found that she<br>was clean, and at twilight she did not ascertain her separation,<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> and after some days she examined<br>herself and found that she was unclean? And they replied:<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> Behold such a woman is in a<br>presumptive state of cleanness. What, I asked, is the law where she examined herself on the sixth,<br>fifth, fourth, third or second? And they replied: There is no difference. As regards an examination on<br>the first day I did not ask, but it was a mistake on my part that I did not ask. For is she not on all<br>these days in a state of presumptive uncleanness and yet as soon as the discharge ceased it is deemed<br>to have completely ceased, so also in regard to the first day as soon as the discharge ceased it may be<br>deemed to have ceased completely’.<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> What view, however, did he<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> hold at first?<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> — [That the<br>woman is unclean] since there is<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> the presumption of an open source.<br><b>MISHNAH</b>.

All is also well<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> with a nazirite who walked under<br>overshadowing branches or mural projections, since Pentateuchally it is necessary<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> that the<br>[overshadowing] tent shall be a proper one and it is only the Rabbis who enacted the ruling<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> as a<br>preventive measure, and no one would mistake a Rabbinic law for a Pentateuchal one; but here,<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> if<br>we were to take into consideration the possibility of a doubtful observation,<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> one might mistake this<br>case for one of a certain observation.<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup><br>It was taught: R.

        "what is the law according to R. Eliezer.<sup>1</sup> Is it necessary<sup>2</sup> that an examination should take place both<br>at the beginning and at the end of the prescribed days<sup>3</sup> [hence this case is excluded]<sup>4</sup> since there was<br>one at the beginning only<sup>5</sup> but not at the end,<sup>6</sup> or is it possible that an examination at the beginning<sup>5</sup><br>suffices although there was none at the end?<sup>6</sup> — Rab replied: The law is the same in either case,<sup>7</sup> an<br>examination at the beginning sufficing although there was none at the end. R. Hanina, however,<br>replied: It is necessary<sup>2</sup> that there be an examination both at the beginning and at the end<sup>8</sup> [hence this<br>case is excluded] since there was one at the beginning only but not at the end.<br>An objection was raised: But both hold the same opinion,<sup>9</sup> where a zab and a zabah examined<br>themselves on the first day and on the eighth day and found themselves clean, that they may count<br>the eighth day only as clean.<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> Now who are referred to in the expression ‘both hold the same<br>opinion’? Is it not R. Eliezer and R. Joshua?<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> — No; R. Joshua and R. Akiba.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup><br>R. Shesheth citing R. Jeremiah b. Abba who had it from Rab stated: If a menstruant has<br>ascertained her separation to a state of cleanness on her third day,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> she may count it in the number<br>of the seven clean days.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> ‘A menstruant’! What need has she for counting?<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> — Rather read: If a<br>zabah has ascertained her separation to a state of cleanness on her third day,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> she may count it in the<br>number of the seven clean days.<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> Said R. Shesheth to R. Jeremiah b. Abba: Did then Rab pronounce<br>his ruling in agreement with the view of the Samaritans who ruled that the day on which a woman<br>ceases to have her discharge may be counted by her in the number of the prescribed seven days?<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> —<br>When Rab spoke he meant: Exclusive of the third day.<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> But if ‘exclusive of the third day’ is not the<br>ruling obvious? — The ruling was necessary only in a case, for instance, where the woman<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> did not<br>examine herself until the seventh day,<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> so that<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> we were informed there<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> that an examination at<br>the beginning<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> suffices although there was none at the end,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> while here<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> we were informed that an<br>examination at the end<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> suffices<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> even though there was none at the beginning.<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> As it might have<br>been presumed that only where there was an examination at the beginning,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> though there was none<br>at the end,<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> do we assume [the days to be clean], because we regard them as remaining in their<br>presumptive state,<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> but not where the examination was held at their conclusion<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> and<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> not at their<br>beginning,<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> hence we were informed [that in either case the days are regarded as clean]. But can<br>this<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> be correct seeing that<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> when Rabin came<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> he stated, ‘R. Jose b. Hanina raised an objection<br>[from a Baraitha dealing with] a forgetful<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> woman but I do not know what his objection was’, and<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup><br>we have an established rule that during the first week of her appearance before us we require her to<br>undergo immersion in the nights<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> but we do not require her to undergo immersion in the day time.<br>Now if it could be entertained that it is not necessary that the days<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> be counted in our presence,<br>she<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> should have been made to undergo immersion in the day time also, since it is possible that she<br>gave birth during a zibah period and had completed the counting on that day. Must it not<br>consequently be inferred from the ruling that it is necessary for the counting to take place in our<br>presence?<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> — But have we not explained this ruling to be in agreement with the view of R. Akiba<br>who ruled that it was necessary for the counting to take place in our presence?<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> — And whence do<br>you infer that according to the Rabbis it is not necessary for the counting to take place in our<br>presence? — From what was taught:<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> ‘If a forgetful<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> woman stated, \"I observed some uncleanness<br>on a certain day\",<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> she<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> is expected to undergo nine immersions, seven<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> in respect of<br>menstruation<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> and two<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> in respect of zibah.<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> If she states, \"I observed some uncleanness at<br>twilight\", she is to undergo eleven immersions’. ‘Eleven’! For what purpose?<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> — R. Jeremiah of<br>Difti replied: This is a case, for instance, where the woman<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> actually appeared before us at<br>twilight,<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> so that provision has to be made for<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> eight immersions in respect of menstruation<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> and<br>for three in respect of zibah.<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> ‘If she states, \"I observed no discharge whatsoever\", she is to undergo<br>fifteen immersions’.<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> Raba observed: ‘This kind of law that is a negation of all reason<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> is in vogue<br>at Galhi where there is a law that one who owns a bull must feed the town's cattle one day while one<br>who owns no bull must feed them on two days. Once they had occasion to deal with<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup> an orphan the<br>son of a widow. Having been entrusted with the bulls [to feed] he proceeded to kill them, saying to<br>the people, \"He who owned a bull shall receive one hide and he who owned no bull shall receive two<br>hides\". \"What\", they said to him, \"is this that you say?\" \"The conclusion of this process\", he<br>answered them, \"follows the same principle as the beginning of the process. Was it not the case with<br>the beginning of this process that one who owned nothing was better off? Well, at the conclusion of<br>the process too, one who owned nothing is better off\". Here also: If where a woman states, \"I<br>observed a discharge\", it suffices for her to undergo either nine immersions or eleven immersions,<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup><br>should it be necessary for her, where she states, \"I observed no discharge whatsoever\", to undergo<br>fifteen immersions?’ — Rather read thus: If she states, ‘I observed a discharge and I do not know<br>how long it continued<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> and whether I observed it during a menstruation period or a zibah one’, she<br>is to undergo fifteen immersions. For if she appeared before us in the day-time we allow her seven<br>days in respect of menstruation<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup><br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Who, in the case of an examination on the first and the seventh, regards all the seven days as clean.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) If the seven days are to be regarded as clean.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Lit,, ‘their beginning and their end’.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) And the days are regarded as unclean,<br>(<sup>5</sup>) On the first of the seven days.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) On the seventh day, the examination having taken place on the eighth.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Lit., ‘it it’, the seven days are regarded as clean in both cases.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Lit., ‘their beginning and their end’.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Lit., ‘and equal’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Lit., ‘that they have only the eighth day’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Who agree in this case with R.

Eliezer?<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) But R. Eliezer maintains, as Rab stated, that since the examination on the first day proved the person to be clean all<br>the seven days also are regarded as clean.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) Since her discharge first appeared.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Sc. the clean days may begin to be counted from that day.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) None, since a menstruant becomes clean after seven days irrespective of whether these were clean or not.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Supra <sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>a.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) The counting beginning from the following day.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Though her discharge ceased on the third day.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) So that the beginning of the counting was not in a condition of ascertained cleanness.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Rab adopting two relaxations of the law.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Where Rab stated that R.

On the second<br>day of her arrival she again undergoes immersion for a similar reason, since it is possible that the day on which her<br>discharge had appeared was not the previous one but the day of her arrival. On the third day no immersion is necessary<br>since it is certain that on the second there was no discharge.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) Sc. why should more immersions be required in this case, where she states that her discharge took place at twilight,<br>than in the former where she does not specify the time of day.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup>) Who did not merely state during the day that her discharge took place at twilight.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup>) And stated that her discharge occurred either earlier or possibly at that very moment when it is doubtful whether it<br>was day or night.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup>) Lit,, ‘and they are’.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>) In addition to the seven immersions as in the former case (beginning on the night that followed the twilight at which<br>she arrived) there must be one on the eighth night because it is possible that her discharge took place actually at the<br>twilight of her arrival which was part of the following night, so that the menstruation period did not terminate until the<br>seven following days have passed and her cleanness is attained by her immersion on the last, which is the eighth night<br>after her arrival.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup>) She performs the first two immersions for the same reason as in the former case, since it is possible that her<br>discharge in zibah took place on the day prior to her arrival (so that immersion must be performed immediately at the<br>twilight when she arrived) or on that day (so that immersion has to be performed on the following day). She must also<br>undergo immersion on the third day since it is possible that the discharge occurred at the twilight at which she arrived<br>and that that time was a part of the night, so that she was unclean on the day following, and having waited the second<br>day she becomes clean on the third when the immersion is performed.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup>) This is discussed presently.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘this law that is no law’.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup>) Lit., ‘it happened to them’.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup>) As explained supra.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup>) Sc. whether it appeared on one day only or on three days.",

But if she<br>appeared at night, does she not require<sup>4</sup> eight in respect of menstruation?<sup>6</sup> — In respect of zibah<br>where the number of immersions is fixed, since it does not vary whether she appeared before us in<br>the day time or at night, [the eighth immersion] was counted, but in respect of menstruation where<br>the number is not fixed, for only where she appeared before us at night does she require eight<br>immersions while if she appeared before us in the day time she does not require eight [the eighth<br>immersion] was not counted. Now, if it could be entertained that it is necessary for all the counting<br>to take place in our presence, what need is there<sup>7</sup> for all these immersions?<sup>8</sup> Should she not rather<br>count the seven days and then undergo immersion?<sup>9</sup> Consequently it may be inferred from here<br>that<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> it is the Rabbis<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> who hold that it is not necessary for the counting to take place in our<br>presence.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> Said R.

Because his uncleanness when alive<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup><br>is not Pentateuchal, but Rabbinical.<br>Our Rabbis taught: Twelve questions did the Alexandrians address to R. Joshua b.

But [then<br>what of] that which was taught,<sup>8</sup> ‘Beth Shammai stated: All men die as zabs and Beth Hillel stated:<br>No dying man is deemed to be a zab unless he died when he was actually one’, why<sup>9</sup> should not one<br>apply here<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> the text, Out of his flesh<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> but not on account of a mishap?<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> — Beth Shammai's reason<br>is rather as it was taught: Formerly they were wont to subject to ritual immersion all utensils that had<br>been used by dying menstruants,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> but as living menstruants felt ashamed in consequence<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> it was<br>enacted that utensils used by all dying women should be subject to immersion,<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> out of a deference<br>to the living menstruants. Formerly they were wont to subject to ritual immersion utensils used by<br>dying zabs,<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> but as living zabs felt ashamed in consequence it was enacted that utensils used by all<br>dying men<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> should be subject to ritual immersion, out of deference to the living zabs.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup><br><b>MISHNAH</b>.

This reason is<br>also that of Beth Shammai in our Mishnah.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Sc. the minutest drop of the blood.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Of a menstrual discharge.

Judah and the first Tanna.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) Not the point whether the blood is menstrual or not.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) According to the first Tanna it is unclean, hence the uncleanness of the blood that was within it when the woman<br>was alive though when it emerged the woman was dead and no longer subject to the uncleanness of menstruation.<br>According to R. Judah it is clean.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) With whom R. Judah agrees only on the one point mentioned. Rashi and Meharsha read ‘R. Jose’ for ‘the first<br>Tanna’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) But how could uncleanness be conveyed in this manner, seeing that the blood issued when the woman was still<br>alive?<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) R. Judah and the first Tanna.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) Not, as has been assumed, the question whether the blood is subject to corpse uncleanness.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) Sc. the blood of a corpse mingled with that of a living person. According to R. Judah, since it is doubtful whether<br>all the blood was detached while the woman was still alive or whether part of it was detached after she died, it is<br>regarded as mingled blood which Rabbinically conveys uncleanness by overshadowing (though Pentateuchally it cannot<br>do so unless the prescribed minimum had been detached after death), while the first Tanna (or R. Jose according to Rashi<br>and Meharsha) maintains that, since the woman was in travail, all the blood that issued may be presumed to have been<br>detached while she was alive so that the question of mingled blood does not arise.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) The corpse uncleanness of which is Rabbinic, and is conveyed by overshadowing.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) Maintaining that in such a case, since one must take into account the possibility that all the quarter of a log may<br>have issued after death, a possible Pentateuchal uncleanness is involved.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) So that it is yet possible for the quantity of blood to increase to the prescribed minimum of a quarter of a log. Where<br>the flow ceased, so that it is certain that the blood issuing after death will never make up the prescribed minimum, not<br>even a Rabbinical prohibition is imposed (cf. Tosaf. Asheri).<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) Though it is certain that a full quarter of a log of blood did not issue after death.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) Of the quarter.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) V. p. <sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup><sup>4</sup>, n. <sup>6</sup>.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) Even if the greater part issued after his death.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) Since the blood did not emerge in a continuous flow but in single drops.",
        "each single drop<sup>1</sup> is detached from the other.<sup>2</sup> But did not the Rabbis speak well to R. Judah?<sup>3</sup> — R.<br>Judah follows his own principle, for he laid down that no blood can neutralize other blood.<sup>4</sup> R.<br>Simeon ruled: If the blood of a man crucified upon the beam was flowing slowly<sup>5</sup> to the ground, and<br>a quarter of a log of blood was found under him, it is unclean.<sup>6</sup> R.

Our Rabbis taught:<br>And both<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> agree<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> that if a woman performs immersion at night after a zibah<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> the immersion is<br>invalid, for both agree that if a woman who observed a discharge during the eleven days<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> and<br>performed immersion in the evening and then had intercourse she conveys uncleanness to couch and<br>seat and both are liable to a sacrifice. They<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> only differ where a discharge occurred on the eleventh<br>day in which case Beth Shammai ruled: They<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> convey uncleanness to couch and seat and are liable<br>to a sacrifice, and Beth Hillel exempt them from the sacrifice. Said Beth Shammai to Beth Hillel:<br>Why should in this respect the eleventh day differ from one of the intermediate of the eleven days;<br>seeing that the former is like the latter in regard to uncleanness, why should it not also be like it in<br>regard to the sacrifice? Beth Hillel answered Beth Shammai: No; if you ruled that a sacrifice is due<br>after a discharge in the intermediate of the eleven days because the following day<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> combines with it<br>in regard to zibah, would you also maintain the same ruling in regard to the eleventh day which<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> is<br>not followed by one that we could combine with it in regard to zibah? Said Beth Shammai to them:<br>You must be consistent;<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> if the one is like the other in regard to uncleanness it should also be like it<br>in regard to the sacrifice, and if it is not like it in regard to the sacrifice it should not be like it in<br>regard to uncleanness either. Said Beth Hillel to them: If we impose upon a man<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> uncleanness in<br>order to restrict the law<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> we cannot on that ground impose upon him the obligation of a sacrifice<br>which might<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> lead to a relaxation of the law.<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> And, furthermore, you stand refuted<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> Out of your<br>own rulings. For, since you rule that if she performed immersion on the next day and having had<br>intercourse she observed a discharge, uncleanness is conveyed to couch and seat and she is exempt<br>from a sacrifice, you also must be consistent.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> If the one is like the other in regard to uncleanness it<br>should also be like it in regard to the sacrifice and if it is not like it in regard to the sacrifice it should<br>not be like it in regard to uncleanness either. The fact, however, is that they are like one another only<br>where the law is thereby restricted but not where it would thereby be relaxed; well, here also, they<br>are like one another where the law is thereby restricted but not where it is thereby relaxed.<br>R. Huna stated: Couches and seats<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> which she occupies on the second day<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> are held to be<br>unclean<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> by Beth Shammai even though she performed immersion<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> and even though she observed<br>no discharge.<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> What is the reason? — Because if she had observed a discharge she would have been<br>unclean,<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> she is therefore now<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> also unclean.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> Said R. Joseph: What new law does he<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup> teach us,<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup><br>seeing that we have learnt, IF SHE PERFORMED IMMERSION ON THE NEXT DAY<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> AND<br>THEN HAD MARITAL INTERCOURSE AND AFTER THAT OBSERVED A DISCHARGE,<br>BETH SHAMMAI RULED: THEY<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> CONVEY UNCLEANNESS TO COUCH AND SEAT<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup><br>AND ARE<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> EXEMPT FROM THE SACRIFICE?<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> R. Kahana objected:<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> Where she observed a<br>discharge<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> the case is different.<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> Said R. Joseph: But what matters it that she observed a<br>discharge<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> seeing that it is one of menstruation?<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> — Abaye answered R. Joseph: R. Kahana<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> had<br>this difficulty: Where the woman did observe a discharge one can well see the reason why<br>uncleanness has been imposed since<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> an observation of menstruation had to be declared unclean as<br>a preventive measure against the possibility of an observation of a discharge of zibah, but where one<br>observed no discharge<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> what possibility was there to be provided against? And, furthermore, we<br>have learnt:<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> If a man observed one discharge of zibah, Beth Shammai ruled: He is like a woman<br>who waits a day for a day<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup> and Beth Hillel ruled: Like a man who emitted semen,<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup><br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Maintaining that a woman who observed a discharge on the eleventh day of her zibah period need not allow a clean<br>day to pass before cleanness can be established.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) But, in accordance with a Rabbinical enactment, are subject to uncleanness, as a preventive measure against a<br>discharge during the eleven days (other than the last) in which case the uncleanness is Pentateuchal unless a portion at<br>least of the following day had passed in cleanness.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) The day following the zibah period (which is the first day of that of menstruation), a portion of that day having<br>passed in cleanness.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) The woman and her husband.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) Rabbinically as a preventive measure (cf. p. <sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup><sup>8</sup>, n. <sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>).<br>(<sup>6</sup>) V. p. <sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup><sup>8</sup>, n. <sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) Since a portion of the day at least, has passed in cleanness. The discharge observed later in the day has no bearing on<br>zibah since that day belonged to the menstruation period.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Lit., ‘behold this’, the person who is in such a hurry as not to allow even one clean day to pass after a zibah<br>discharge.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) Sexually. Such hurry is indecent, since it might lead one to act similarly in the case of a discharge in the intermediate<br>days of the zibah period when a Pentateuchal prohibition might be infringed. The uncleanness of zibah, however, does<br>not apply.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Other than the last.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Husband and wife.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) Though no discharge appeared on the following day.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Since, as a minor zabah (one who experienced a discharge on one of the days of a zibah period) she must allow one<br>clean day to pass before she can regard herself as clean.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) So that a part of the day at least had passed in cleanness.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) Lit., ‘bad’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) Because a discharge that might possibly occur later in the day would continue and extend the uncleanness of the<br>previous day and render the immersion invalid.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) Until the evening. If later in the day she experienced a discharge their touch conveys the uncleanness of zibah and<br>they are liable to bring the prescribed sacrifice; but if no discharge appeared the touch conveys no uncleanness and no<br>liability to a sacrifice is incurred.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) Though Beth Hillel hold that, where a discharge appeared on the eleventh day and immersion was performed in the<br>evening, intercourse in that night does not involve the bringing of a sacrifice.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) Sc. on any day other than the eleventh.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Husband and wife.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) Which is also one of the days of the zibah period.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup>) Being the last of the zibah days and followed by the first of those of menstruation.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>) Lit., ‘make your measures equal’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>) Lit., ‘we brought him’.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup>) Rabbinically.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup>) In case the sacrifice is not obligatory.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup>) Offering on the altar an unconsecrated beast.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup>) Noshekin, lit., ‘you bite’. Golds. suggests the reading mushabin, ‘you are answered’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup>) Lit., ‘make your measures equal’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup>) So MS.M. and Rashi. Cur. edd. ‘her couch and seat’.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup>) Sc. the day following one of the intermediate days of the zibah period on which she experienced a discharge.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>) Rabbinically.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup>) On the second day.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup>) Retrospectively, in accordance with Pentateuchal law, since the discharge on the second day is joined to that on the<br>first to constitute a continuous zibah.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup>) As a preventive measure.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>8</sup>) R. Huna.<br>(<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>) By his statement.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>) The day following the eleventh of a zibah period, which is the first of the following menstruation period, and a<br>discharge on which cannot be treated as a continuation of the zibah discharge of the previous day.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup>) Cur. edd. use here the fem. sing.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup>) In cur. edd., the plural is here used.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>) Now, since a discharge on the twelfth day cannot be treated as a continuation of that on the eleventh (cf. prev. n. but<br>two) and since it does not invalidate the immersion on that day, that discharge, as far as zibah is concerned, might well<br>be regarded as if it had never occurred. The case is consequently similar to that of R. Huna where a discharge on an<br>intermediate day in the zibah period was followed by a day on which none had occurred. As in the Mishnah, where the<br>second discharge occurred on the twelfth, uncleanness has been imposed Rabbinically as a preventive measure against<br>the possibility of a second discharge occurring on the eleventh so also in the case of R. Huna uncleanness must be<br>imposed where no discharge occurred on the second day as a preventive measure against the possibility of a discharge<br>occurring on the second day. What need then was there for R. Huna to make a statement which is implicit in the ruling of<br>our Mishnah?<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup>) Against R. Huna.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>) The case dealt with in our Mishnah though that discharge could not be attributed to zibah.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup>) From one where there was no discharge at all. How then could R. Huna maintain his statement?<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup>) The case in our Mishnah.<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup>) Which cannot be attributed to zibah; and consequently (cf. p. <sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup><sup>1</sup>, n. <sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) might be regarded (as in the case of R.<br>Huna) as if no discharge had taken place. What then is the basis of R. Kahana's objection?<br>(<sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup>) Who advanced the opinion that ‘where she observed a discharge the case is different’.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup>) The ruling concerning one discharge being likely to be misunderstood for that of another discharge.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup>) And since the absence of a discharge is not likely to be misunderstood for a discharge.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup>) Contrary to the view of R. Huna.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>3</sup>) Sc. who must allow one clean day to pass for every day on which she experienced a discharge before she may be<br>regarded as clean. As the uncleanness of the touch of such a woman on the second day after she performed immersion is<br>left in suspense to provide against the possibility of a discharge appearing later in the day, so must also be the<br>uncleanness of such a person if after experiencing the discharge he performed immersion. If, e.g., he touches tithe its<br>uncleanness must remain in suspense in case he observes a second discharge which would continue his former zibah.<br>(<sup>5</sup><sup>4</sup>) Sc. he is clean in regard to tithe immediately after his immersion. At all events it was here stated that, according to<br>Beth Shammai, a woman who waits a day for a day is on a par with a man who experienced a first discharge of zibah.",
        "and it was taught:<sup>1</sup> If a man<sup>2</sup> caused the shaking of the [first] observed discharge, Beth Shammai<br>ruled: The man must be held in suspense,<sup>3</sup> and Beth Hillel declared him clean.<sup>4</sup> As to couches and<br>seats occupied between a first and a second discharge, Beth Shammai hold them in suspense and<br>Beth Hillel declare them clean. Now in the first clause it was stated, ‘If a man observed one<br>discharge of zibah, Beth Shammai ruled: He is like a woman who waits a day for a day’, from which<br>it is evident, is it not, that in the case of a woman who waits a day for a day the uncleanness is held<br>in suspense?<sup>5</sup> — Do not read, ‘A woman who waits a day for a day’ but read: Like a man who had<br>intercourse with one who waits a day for a day.<sup>6</sup> But why is it that he<sup>7</sup> does not convey uncleanness<br>to couch and seat,<sup>8</sup> while she does convey uncleanness to them?<sup>9</sup> — About him, since he does not<br>usually bleed, the Rabbis enacted no preventive measure,<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> but in her case, since she does usually<br>bleed, the Rabbis enacted a preventive measure. But<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> why is it that she conveys uncleanness to<br>couch and seat and does not convey uncleanness to the man who had intercourse with her? — To<br>couch and seat which are in common use she conveys uncleanness but to the man who had<br>intercourse, which in such circumstances is an unusual occurrence, no uncleanness is conveyed.<br>We learnt, IF SHE PERFORMED IMMERSION ON THE NEXT DAY AND THEN HAD<br>INTERCOURSE, SUCH AN ACT IS IMPROPER CONDUCT, BUT THE UNCLEANNESS OF<br>THEIR TOUCH AND THEIR LIABILITY TO A SACRIFICE ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR<br>INTERCOURSE ARE IN SUSPENSE. Does not this represent the general view?<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> — No, it is only<br>the view of Beth Hillel. For it was taught: Said R. Judah to Beth Hillel: Do you then call such an act<br>improper conduct, seeing that this man only intended to have intercourse with a menstruant? — ‘A<br>menstruant’! How could such an idea be entertained? — Rather read: To have intercourse with a<br>zabah. ‘A zabah’! How could this idea be entertained? — Rather read: To have intercourse with one<br>who waits a day for a day.<br>It was stated: As to the tenth day,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> R. Johanan ruled, The tenth is on a par with the ninth; as the<br>ninth<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> must be followed<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> by observation<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> so must the tenth<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> be followed by observation.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> Resh<br>Lakish ruled: The tenth is on a par with the eleventh; as the eleventh<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> need not be followed by<br>observation<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> so the tenth need not be followed by observation.<br>Some there are who teach this<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> in connection with the following. R. Eleazar b. ‘Azariah said to R.<br>Akiba, Even if you were all day to draw inferences from<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> the repetition of ‘with oil’<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> I would not<br>listen to you, the fact being that the prescribed quantities of half a log of oil for a<br>thanksgiving-offering, and a quarter of a log of wine for a nazirite, and the eleven days that intervene<br>between one menstruation period and the next are the halachah of Moses handed down from Sinai.<br>What is the ‘halachah’ referred to? — R. Johanan replied: The one halachah applicable to the<br>eleventh day.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> Resh Lakish replied: The halachahs<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> applicable to the eleventh day. ‘R. Johanan<br>replied: The one halachah applicable to the eleventh day’ i.e., the eleventh day<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> only need not be<br>followed<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> by a day of observation<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> but for the other days<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> it<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> does serve as a day of observation.<br>But ‘Resh Lakish replied: The halachahs applicable to the eleventh day’, i.e., neither need the<br>eleventh be followed by one of observation nor does it serve as one of observation for the tenth.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup><br>But are these<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> halachahs? Are they not in fact derived from Scriptural texts? For it was taught: As it<br>might have been presumed that if a woman observes a discharge on three consecutive days at the<br>beginning of a menstruation period she shall be a zabah,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> and that the text<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> ‘If a woman have an<br>issue and her issue in her flesh be blood’<sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> applies<sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> to one who observed a discharge on one day<br>only<sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> it was, therefore, explicitly stated,<br>____________________<br>(<sup>1</sup>) Regarding a zab who experienced one discharge.<br>(<sup>2</sup>) Who was clean.<br>(<sup>3</sup>) Until evening. If the zab experienced a second discharge on that day he becomes a confirmed zab retrospectively and<br>the man who shook the discharge becomes unclean.<br>(<sup>4</sup>) As is the case with one who caused the shaking of semen who remains clean.<br>(<sup>5</sup>) And if she experiences no second discharge she is clean.<br>(<sup>6</sup>) Because R. Huna agrees in the case of the man that, if the intercourse took place on the second day after the woman's<br>immersion, the question of his uncleanness must he held in suspense and that before a second discharge appears he is<br>even Rabbinically free from certain uncleanness.<br>(<sup>7</sup>) The man who had the intercourse.<br>(<sup>8</sup>) Which he alone occupied.<br>(<sup>9</sup>) To couch and seat that have been occupied by her.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>) That, even where the woman observed no discharge after their intercourse, he shall convey uncleanness to couch<br>and seat.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>) Since a preventive measure was enacted in her case on account of her tendency to bleed.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>) Even that of Beth Shammai who accordingly hold that on the day following a discharge during the intermediate<br>days of the zibah period the woman's touch causes only a suspended uncleanness. An objection thus arises against R.<br>Huna who maintained that according to Beth Shammai couch and seat in such circumstances are held to be unclean.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>) Sc. a first discharge on the tenth day of the zibah period. Such a discharge can never develop into a major zibah (by<br>being repeated on three consecutive days) since the tenth day is followed by one day only of the zibah period (the<br>eleventh) the twelfth being the first of the next menstruation period.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>) Since a discharge on it may develop (if it is repeated on the tenth and the eleventh) into a major zibah.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>) Lit., ‘requires’.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>) On the next day.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>) If it was the first day in the zibah period on which a discharge appeared.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>) On the eleventh; though a repeated discharge on the latter day would not constitute a major zibah.<br>(<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup>) Which is the last day of the zibah period.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>) According to Beth Hillel the day following being one of menstruation.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>) The dispute between R. Johanan and Resh Lakish.<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>) Lit., increase, i.e., to regard every Scriptural mention of ‘with oil’, in connection with the thanksgiving-offering, as<br>implying an addition to the quantity specified. Any two additions imply a reduction (cf. Zeb. <sup>8</sup><sup>2</sup>a, <sup>8</sup><sup>9</sup>a).<br>(<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>) Lit., ‘with oil, with oil,’ (cf.

It was explicitly stated, Or if she have an issue.<sup>6</sup> Thus I only know about<br>an interval of one day, whence is it deduced that the restrictions extend [where the day or the days on<br>which the discharge appeared were] separated [from the menstruation period] by two, three, four,<br>five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten days? You may reason thus: As we find in the case of the fourth<br>day<sup>7</sup> that<sup>8</sup> it is suitable for the counting<sup>9</sup> and<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> is also appropriate as one for zibah<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> so may I also<br>introduce<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> the tenth day<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> since it is both suitable for the prescribed counting<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> and appropriate as<br>one for zibah.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> But whence is it deduced that the eleventh day<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> is also included?<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> It was explicitly<br>stated, Not in the time of her menstruation.<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> Might I also<sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> include<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> the twelfth day?<sup>7</sup> You must<br>admit that this cannot be done.<sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup> But what reason do you see for including<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> the eleventh and for<br>excluding the twelfth? I include the eleventh since it is suitable for being counted [as one of the<br>seven clean days following the one<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup> that is deduced<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> from] ‘or if she have an issue’<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> and I exclude<br>the twelfth since it is not suitable for being counted as one of the seven clean days following the one<br>that is deduced from ‘or if she have an issue’.<sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> But so far I only know that zibah<sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> is established<br>after a discharge on<sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> three days, whence is it deduced that the restrictions apply to a discharge on<br>two days? It was explicitly stated, Days.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> Whence the deduction that the same applies also to a<br>discharge on one day? It was explicitly stated, All the days.<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> ‘Unclean’,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> implies that she conveys<br>uncleanness to the man who had intercourse with her like a menstruant. ‘She’,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> implies that only<br>she conveys uncleanness to the man who had intercourse with her but that the zab conveys no<br>uncleanness to the woman with whom he had intercourse. But is there not an argument [a minori ad<br>majus]: If she, who does not contract uncleanness on account of observation<sup>2</sup><sup>8</sup> as on account of<br>days,<sup>2</sup><sup>9</sup> does convey uncleanness to the man who had intercourse with her, is there not more reason<br>that the man who does contract uncleanness on account of observation as on account of days<sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup><br>should convey uncleanness to the woman with whom he had intercourse? It was expressly stated,<br>‘she’,<sup>2</sup><sup>7</sup> implying that only she conveys uncleanness to the man who had intercourse with her but that<br>a zab does not convey uncleanness to the woman with whom he had intercourse. But whence is it<br>deduced that he conveys uncleanness to couch and seat? It was expressly stated, As the bed of her<br>menstruation.<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> From this,<sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> however, I would only know the case of a man who experienced a<br>discharge on three days, whence the deduction that the restrictions apply to a discharge on two days?<br>It was explicitly stated, ‘Days’. But whence the deduction that the same applies to a discharge on one<br>day? It was stated, ‘All the days’ — And whence do we infer that the woman must count one day to<br>correspond to one day?<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> It was stated, She shall be.<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> As it might have been presumed that she<br>should count seven days after a discharge has appeared on two days only, this being arrived at by the<br>following argument, ‘If the man who does not count one day to correspond to one day<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> counts<br>seven days after a discharge on two days, how much more reason is there that she who does count<br>one day to correspond to one day<sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> should count seven days after a discharge on two days’, it was<br>explicitly stated, She shall be,<sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> implying that she counts one day only.
